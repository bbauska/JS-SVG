<h2 id="#0-intro">Introduction</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
A caveat before we begin: generative art, and creative coding more
generally, can become an all-consuming addiction. "Just one more
iteration" is a refrain you might hear from those unfortunate artists
caught in its thrall. Creatives craving that next generative hit mixed
with just the right amount of randomness.

The purpose of this website is to deal out this computational devilry in
small doses, in a clear, logical fashion, so you can approach this topic
safely and with your sanity intact. We will encounter organic forms
borne of mechanical precision, unpredictable swathes of color cover our
screens, lines and shapes flocking together in impossible harmony, and
see complex structures emerge from simple rules. This is the essence of
generative art, where not all is in your control.

That said, it's a medium that requires time, patience, and skill on the
part of the artist -- no less so than with other artistic mediums. And
although I might be exaggerating the power it has over its
practitioners, the point I really want to make is that coding has this
expressive side to it -- it can be frustrating and headache-inducing,
sure -- but it can also fascinate and inspire. If I can equip you with
some new generative tools and techniques, and in the process excite you
just a little about their creative possibilities -- possibilities that
extend beyond the field of art into those of design and web development
-- this book will have more than done its job.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 id="#ch0-know">What You Should Know</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
As a reader, what should you know before tackling this book? It will no doubt be easier 
if you are comfortable with the core concepts of programming, like variables, functions, 
loops, and conditionals. These kinds of concepts carry over from language to language, 
differing mainly with respect to syntax, so if you come from a language other than
JavaScript, then that's completely fine.

If you have no prior programming experience, we will be covering the concepts required in 
Chapter 2, but I should emphasize that this book is not intended to be an introduction to 
programming. The second chapter is best thought of as a primer, a jumping-off point for a 
deeper dive elsewhere. A short introductory course would really benefit you here. Personally 
I'd recommend the wonderful <a href="https://freeCodeCamp.com/" target="_blank" 
rel="noreferrer noopener">freeCodeCamp.com</a>, a site I've spent many hours using myself. It 
offers free interactive tutorials on the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and much more besides.

For those coming from another language, like Python, PHP, or C#, the second chapter may 
still be valuable, to be sure you're acquainted with the syntax and some of the 
idiosyncrasies of JavaScript.

If you're already a practicing web developer, you could skip (or quickly skim) Chapter 2, 
depending on your level of experience. If you're unfamiliar with any of the techniques or 
syntax used in our opening example (which we'll end Chapter 1 with), I'd encourage you to 
give the second chapter a read, where they'll be fully explained. The field of web 
development is vast enough that what is bread and butter to one developer might be bleeding 
edge to another.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 id="#ch0-learn">What You Will Learn</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
I mentioned previously that I'll be equipping you with some new tools and techniques. 
Let's flesh these out.

Introduction **Tools**

On the tool end of things, we'll be using the following:

<ol start="1">
  <li>JavaScript and the SvJs library. I'll elaborate on this further later.</li>
  <li>A code editor. Here I'll be giving you a choice between
    <ol>
	  <li>Visual Studio Code (an excellent open source code editor)</li>
	  <li>CodePen (a popular online code editor)</li>
	</ol>
  <li>If you opt to use Visual Studio Code (which I recommend), we'll also
    be using Node.js and NPM to manage dependencies (a good habit to get
	into as a developer).</li>
</ol>

All code examples are available on both GitHub and CodePen, so feel free to follow along 
whichever way you prefer. You can of course do both, work locally with a code editor but 
check out CodePen examples online for quick inspiration. For convenience, I'll organize 
and embed all CodePen examples at <a href="https://davidmatthew.ie/generative-art-javascript-svg" 
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">davidmatthew.ie/generative-art-javascript-svg</a>.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h3>Techniques</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
In terms of the techniques we'll tackle, by the end of this book, you should have a good 
overview of the following:
<ul>
  <li>The main functionality of the SvJs library and how it relates to the SVG spec,</li>
  <li>Creating generative art sketches with JavaScript using ES6+ syntax,</li>

We'll be covering a lot of ground, so don't put yourself under pressure to understand 
everything. I must have encountered certain programming concepts umpteen times before 
the proverbial penny finally dropped (JavaScript promises anyone?), and whenever 
understanding did finally dawn, it would usually be because I was experimenting with 
something I *wanted* to build, rather than repeating tutorial steps by rote. Tutorials 
and instructional books certainly have their place (I wouldn't be writing this book 
otherwise), but it's important that you take what *you* want from them, rather than 
seeing them as syllabi to be strictly followed.

A sense of play is important, particularly when it comes to art. And although I 
mentioned tools previously, I would prefer if you viewed this book as more of a toybox 
than a toolbox. When I think of tools, I think of problems that need fixing, like the 
loose hinges on that crooked cabinet you're going to tighten any day now. Tools tend to 
be more functional than fun, and I'd like you to have some fun with this book.

<h1 href="#ch1">CHAPTER 1: The Beginner's Path</h1>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Before journeying along any path, the groundwork needs to be in place. In this opening 
chapter, that's what we'll do, lay the groundwork. We'll introduce SVG, explain what 
makes it a uniquely powerful image format, and show how it can be used with JavaScript 
to create generative art. In the process, we'll set up our tools and a template we can 
use for subsequent sketches.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 hre="#ch1-1">1.1 Why JavaScript and SvJs?</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Most books about generative art use a Java-based language called Processing, or its 
JavaScript port p5.js. Processing was created specifically for artists and designers new 
to coding and has a large and active community. So why doesn't this book use it?

My first forays into generative art were with Processing, so I certainly acknowledge its 
value. I quickly moved to p5.js when the library was first released in 2013, which 
allowed generative sketches to be written directly in JavaScript, the language of the 
Web. But when I wanted to integrate some of my own sketches into real-world web 
development projects, its limitations quickly showed. It's a *large* library, clocking in 
at close to a megabyte at last check, and while that may not sound like much, it's a lot 
by web development standards.

<!-- Â© David Matthew 2024 1
D. Matthew, *Generative Art with JavaScript and SVG*, Design Thinking,
<https://doi.org/10.1007/979-8-8688-0086-3_1> -->
<!-- page 2 -->

The p5.js library is built on top of the HTML Canvas API, which I soon discovered is 
actually quite straightforward to use. Using this API directly, I was able to achieve 
much the same results as with p5.js, so that became my go-to. However, the output of all 
my sketches -- p5.js or Canvas -- was still resolution-dependent bitmap graphics, devoid 
of any semantic content. What does that mean, and why does it matter (to me at least)? 
Let me explain.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 href="#ch1-1a">1.1a Introducing Scalable Vector Graphics</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Back in the early days of the Web, when dial-up modems were dominant and
connecting to the Internet was anything but instant, bandwidth came at a
premium. File sizes had to be super small if you wanted a page to load
in your lifetime, and bitmap images, such as JPGs and PNGs, were the
main bandwidth bottleneck.

Bitmap images -- also known as raster images -- are comprised of large
chunks of data (or bits), and generally speaking, if you want a larger
image, you need more bits, which means a bigger file size. SVG, on the
other hand, is a vector format, which is fundamentally different. SVG
can be scaled to any dimension, all without a corresponding increase in
file size, and it is always dazzlingly sharp and crisp. This is possible
because it doesn't bother itself with the bits (i.e., pixels) needed to
paint the image to the screen, but rather describes the image to be
rendered at a more abstract, semantic level. And it does this in much
the same way that HTML describes the structure and content of a web page. 
As the Mozilla Developer Network puts it

<blockquote>
SVG is, essentially, to graphics what HTML is to text.
</blockquote>
<!-- page 3 -->

The SVG format was not only a powerful solution to a practical bandwidth
problem; it was a nonproprietary format officially standardized by the
World Wide Web Consortium (which is as good as future-proofing gets in
the world of web technology). The stage was set for its adoption as far
back as 1999, but unfortunately browser vendors dragged their feet and
were extremely slow to introduce support. So for the longest time (in
Internet terms at least), SVG languished in obscurity. It only really
got the support it deserved with the decline of Flash (Adobe's
proprietary format that required a plug-in to run and was often riddled
with security vulnerabilities) and the rise of responsive design and
retina (or high PPI) screens, where its scalability and sharpness really
shine.

These days we can use the format freely without worry, but to use it for
the odd icon and logo is one thing; to tap its full potential is
another.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 href="#ch1-1b">1.1b Native SVG</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
As SVG is a declarative language like HTML, it's very human-readable and
easy to get started with. Just like HTML elements, SVG elements are
written using opening and closing angle brackets and contain attributes
with values. Here, for example, is how you'd create a circle:

```
<circle r="125" cy="250" cx="250" fill="cyan"/>
```

The attributes r, cx, cy, and fill in the preceding example refer to the
circle's radius, the x and y coordinates of its center, and the color to
fill it with. All are sensibly named and simple to follow.

Some SVG elements will contain other elements nested within them,
referred to as their child nodes or children, and will therefore need
opening and closing tags. One prominent example is the parent \<svg\>
element itself, which contains all other SVG elements.

As an example of how you might handwrite an SVG, here is the markup
underlying a very simple composition in the style of Hilma af Klint,
arguably the first abstract artist in Western art history.

```
<svg width="500" height="500" style="background-color: #ad3622">
<title>A simple Hilma af Klint-inspired knock-off</title>
<circle r="125" cy="250" cx="250" fill="#d0d1c9"/>
<circle r="100" cy="250" cx="250" fill="#1c1c1c"/>
<circle r="75" cy="250" cx="250" fill="#5085b4"/>
<circle r="50" cy="250" cx="250" fill="#d6a946"/>
</svg>
```

As you can see, SVG is written in such a way as to preserve the
semantics of the code. Search engines love this; no longer are they
looking at an impenetrable wall of pixels; they can clearly see the
*intent* within the markup. In this case, four circles displayed in the
order they're written, with a title for extra accessibility. Figure 1-1
shows how this markup appears when rendered.

![](./images/image007.jpg){width="3.15in" height="3.15in"}

***Figure 1-1.** A simple composition in the style of Hilma af Klint's Svanen (The Swan)*

<!-- page 5 -->

Declarative formats are straightforward to read, but their weakness is
that they can become tedious to write. What if we wanted 100 circles
instead of four? With native SVG, we'd have to handwrite all of them,
one after the other. And if we wanted to display our circles at random
cx and cy positions, each with a randomly selected fill, this isn't
possible at all. Variables, loops, functions, and all the fun stuff of
imperative programming aren't available to us. Declarative formats are
concerned more with the *what* of a program rather than the *how*. The
how, however, will very much matter to us. Without the how, we wouldn't
have algorithms, and algorithms are essential to generative art.

Algorithms are like recipes; they contain the steps you need to follow
to achieve a certain result. If you're baking a cake, you don't just
shout "Cake!" and expect one to materialize, no matter how specific you
get with your declaration ("with strawberry icing and a caramel
filling!"). This would be the declarative approach, and in practice, it
sounds more than a little eccentric. To bake a cake, you follow a series
of well-defined steps or instructions and have your ingredients and your
oven at the ready. This is akin to the imperative approach in
programming; it's more hands-on, and sometimes things get messy. But
ultimately it gives you more creative control.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 href="#ch1-1c">1.1c Generating SVG</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
So if native SVG doesn't allow for the use of algorithms, how do we
write SVG using an imperative approach? The answer is we *script* our
SVG, and this is where JavaScript and SvJs come into play.

We could script SVG directly in JavaScript without a library, but that
too has its challenges, the main one being the verbose boilerplate code
we'd have to write. The SvJs library saves us that trouble, making SVG
more intuitive and fun to write. Here's an example of a simple SVG
(Figure 1-2) written using vanilla JavaScript:
<!-- page 6 -->

```
const svg = document.createElementNS('<http://www.w3.org/2000/svg>', 'svg'); 
svg.setAttribute('width', '150px');
svg.setAttribute('height', '150px'); 
const div = document.getElementById('container'); 
div.appendChild(svg); 
const rect = document.createElementNS('<http://www.w3.org/2000/ svg>', 'rect');
rect.setAttribute('x', '0'); 
rect.setAttribute('y', '0');
rect.setAttribute('width', '150'); 
rect.setAttribute('height', '150'); 
rect.setAttribute('fill', 'cornflowerblue');
svg.appendChild(rect);
```

And the following snippet is the equivalent SVG written using SvJs
(don't worry about the details just yet; all you need to note is how
concise it is vs. vanilla JavaScript). The output of this code you can
see in Figure 1-2.

```
const div = document.getElementById('stage'); 
const svg = new SvJs().set({ width: '150px', height: '150px' }).addTo(div); 
svg.create('rect').set({ 
  x: 0, y: 0, width: 150, height: 150, fill: 'cornflowerblue'
});
```
<!-- page 7 -->

![](./images/image008.jpg){width="3.15in" height="3.15in"}

***Figure 1-2.** A cornflower blue-colored rectangle, in all its glory*

Now you *could* write some functions to make writing vanilla JavaScript
less painful, but that leads you down the road of writing a whole host
of other utility functions to make the basics less burdensome. With
SvJs, I've done my best to save you this trouble. It's essentially a
very thin wrapper over the real SVG spec with some helpful generative
functions thrown in. This keeps its footprint extremely light while
maintaining fidelity to the SVG spec.

SvJs was inspired by the gySVG library, a similarly light but more
general-purpose JavaScript library that comes complete with a plug-in
API and modern framework support. I was initially going to use gySVG and
extend its functionality with a plug-in, but this plug-in soon grew to
the point where it made more sense to write my own library with a
specific focus on generative art. This was how SvJs came to be.
<!-- page 8 -->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 href="#ch1-2">1.2 Getting Set Up</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Enough with the preamble. Let's get ourselves set up to write some code.

<h2 id="ch1-2a">1.2a The Code Editor</h3>

If you don't have VS Code already running on your machine, head on over
to [code.visualstudio.com]{.underline} and download and install the
appropriate version for your operating system.

If you can't install a code editor on your machine or would just prefer
to follow along online, you can use CodePen instead. Go to
[codepen.io]{.underline} and sign up an account if you're not already
registered.

I will be writing the examples throughout this book with the VS Code
editor and local files in mind; the same code can be found online via
the CodePen versions with some minimal differences (such as how we
import the SvJs library and the lack of HTML boilerplate which CodePen
automatically provides).
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 href="#ch1-2b">1.2b Node.js and NPM</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
You can skip this part if you intend to use CodePen only, but I would
still recommend getting familiar with Node.js if you have any plans on
getting into the field of web development.

Node.js is an open source JavaScript runtime environment that allows you
to set up your own JavaScript-powered server. It also allows you to
manage dependencies via the included package manager NPM.

Go to nodejs.org and download and install the latest LTS (long-term
support) version.

<!-- page 9 -->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 href="#ch1-2c">1.2c Initializing and Installing SvJs</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Create a base folder where you'll save all the work related to this
book, and name it something like generative-svg.

Open up VS Code, select File **â¤** Open File, and navigate to this
folder. Next, select the Terminal **â¤** New Terminal command, and you
should see a new window appear at the bottom of the screen referencing
the current folder location. It should look something like this:

```
your-name@computer-name ~/Documents/generative-svg
```

The important thing is that the path references the folder you created
in the last step (i.e., generative-svg). Once you've verified that,
you're ready to initialize the project. To do this, type the following
into the terminal: npm init -y

What this does is run Node's package manager NPM, and the init command
initializes the project, or "package." The -y flag just tells npm that
we want to accept all default setup options. You should notice a new
file has been created, called package.json. This is a file you'll see a
lot of in web development, but you don't need to worry about its
contents right now. Just know that its purpose is to manage our
dependencies, the main one being the SvJs library.

To install SvJs, run the following command:

```
npm install svjs
```

This will add a new line in the package.json file, referencing the
version of SvJs you've just installed. A package-lock.json file will
also be created (a file you'll never need to look at) and a node_modules
folder, where SvJs and any of its dependencies are stored (it doesn't
have any so you won't see additional folders here).

<!-- page 10 -->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 href="#ch1-2d">1.2d Scaffolding Our Sketches</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Our first sketch will require a little HTML and CSS before we tackle the
JavaScript. We'll keep this markup and styling minimal and more or less
identical throughout the book, as our real focus will be on the
JavaScript.

Let's create a new folder called sketches inside the base folder, and
inside sketches create a new folder called 00-template. We'll number our
folders so that they sort nicely. The 00-template folder will contain
the very basics we'll copy from one sketch to another. Inside 00-
template create a file called index.html and another called sketch.js.
Once you've done that, you should have a folder structure like this:

<blockquote>
generative-svg
\|\-- node_modules
\|\-- sketches
  \|\-- 00-template
    \|\-- index.html
    \|\-- sketch.js
\|\-- package-lock.json
\|\-- package.json
</blockquote>

Open the index.html file. It's worth noting that VS Code can generate
some boilerplate markup for you if you type ! and press the tab key, but
I'll include our boilerplate in full here so you can copy and paste it.
Generally, I recommend you write out the example code yourself and limit
the "control-c-control-v" activity where possible, as you're less likely
to learn this way. Here, however, it's fine, as HTML and CSS aren't our
focus.
<!-- page 11 -->

```
<!DOCTYPE html>

  </style>
  <title>SvJs Template</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="container"></div>
  <script src="./sketch.js" type="module"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

There's just a couple of things worth pointing out about the preceding
code: our \<div id=\"container\"\> will be where the generative art
actually happens. It will be our canvas, so to speak. I have placed it
within the center of the screen, removed any default margins, and given
the template an overall "dark-mode" feel (my own personal preference).

Below the \<div\> you'll see a \<script\> tag. This is where we'll pull
in all our code, so any further modifications to the HTML will be
unnecessary going forward (other than maybe updating the \<title\> tag
for each sketch, but I'll leave that up to you). The script is set to
type=\"module\". What this does is allow us to handle the import of
other files and libraries that are packaged (or exported) as modules.
This is a good practice to get into, and it's also how we're going to
import the SvJs library.
<!-- page 12 -->
Open up the sketch.js file and include this as your first two lines:

```
// Import the SvJs library. 
import { SvJs } from '../../node_modules/svjs/src/index.js';
```

Our template is now complete, ready to be copied for subsequent sketches. Well done!
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 href="#ch1-2e">1.2e Serving Our Sketches</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
If you navigate to the 00-template folder at this point and double-click
on index.html to open it in a web browser, you'll see some errors in the
developer console (accessible by pressing F12 on most browsers). This is
because we need to serve our HTML files using the http:// protocol
rather than the file:// protocol (you'll see the protocol prefix if you
check the full URL in the address bar).

To rectify this, we need to install an http server. And ideally one that
detects file changes and instantly reloads our page, saving us from
having to manually refresh our browser each time (which becomes a pain
after a while). There's a neat little package called live-server that
takes care of this for us. To install it, run the following in the
terminal:

```
npm install live-server -g
```

The -g flag tells npm to install this package globally on our machine,
rather than locally to the project in question. As it's more a general-
purpose utility than a project-specific dependency, this is what we
want.

To get live-server to run, all you need to do is type live-server into
the terminal. It will then automatically open a new browser window where
you'll see your project files (assuming you're still in the project's
base folder in VS Code). Navigate to sketches **â¤** 00-template and you
should see your page load free of any console errors. It's also free of
any content though, so let's write some code to address this.
<!-- page 13 -->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 href="#ch1-3">1.3 Our First Generative Sketch</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
As I mentioned previously, our first sketch will serve as a basis for
explaining the fundamental programming concepts we'll be covering in
Chapter 2, so what follows is, for this reason, rather light on
explanations (other than some comments in the code itself).

Make a copy of the 00-template folder and call it 01-our-first-
generative-sketch, ensuring to copy it to the same location (i.e., so
that the parent folder is sketches).

Then, either write out the following code (recommended) or copy it into
your sketch.js file, below the import statement. Read the comments as
you go (the lines starting with //), which I've purposely kept quite
verbose so you can get a better handle on what's happening.

```
// Import the SvJs library. 
import { SvJs } from '../../node_modules/svjs/src/index.js';

// Create some global variables. 
const svgSize = window.innerWidth > window.innerHeight ?
window.innerHeight : window.innerWidth; 
const bgColor = '#181818';

// Create an object to store some of our randomised parameters.
const randomised = { 
  hue: random(0, 360), 
  rotation: random(-180, 180),
  iterations: random(10, 100)
}

// Create our parent SVG and attach it to the element with id 'container'. 
const svg = new SvJs(); 
svg.addTo(document.getElementById('container'));

// Set the width and height of the viewBox and the displayed size of the SVG.
svg.set({ viewBox: '0 0 1000 1000', width: svgSize, height: svgSize });

// Create a background layer - a rectangle the full size of our viewBox.
const rect = svg.create('rect'); rect.set({ x: 0, y: 0, width: 1000, height: 1000, fill: bgColor });

// Run a loop a random number of times to create our ellipses. 
for (let i = 0; i < randomised.iterations; i += 1) {

  // Set the centre point, the x and y radii of our ellipse and its rotation.
  let center = 500; 
  let radiusX = 100 + (i * 3);
  let radiusY = 300 + (i * 2);
  let rotation = randomised.rotation + (i * 2);
  // If our random hue is less than 180, increment it. Otherwise decrement it. 
  let hue; 
  if (randomised.hue < 180) { 
    hue = randomised.hue + (i * 3);
  } else {
    hue = randomised.hue - (i * 3);
  }
  // Create our ellipse. 
  let ellipse = svg.create('ellipse');
  ellipse.set({
    cx: center, 
	cy: center, 
	rx: radiusX, 
	ry: radiusY, 
	fill: 'none', 
	stroke: `hsl(${hue} 80% 80% / 0.6)`, 
	transform: `rotate(${rotation} ${center} ${center})`
  });
}
/** 
 * Gets a random number between a minimum and maximum value.
 */
function random(min, max, integer = true) {
  let random = Math.random() * (max - min) + min; 
  let number = integer ? Math.floor(random) : random; 
  return number; 
}
```

Ok, so quite the code dump! It will no doubt overwhelm anyone new to
coding, so if you fall into this category and find yourself balking at
the aforementioned, please bear with me; all will be explained in the
forthcoming chapters. The purpose of this first generative sketch is to
just jump in and show you some quick results.

When you save the aforementioned, you should see something like Figure
1-3. Each refresh of the browser will render a unique version, so what
you see will no doubt differ in some respects. But that, dear reader, is
part of the joy of generative art.

Coming up next: a programming primer.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h1 href="#ch2">CHAPTER 2: A Programming Primer</h1>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Although programming can be used to create art, it can also be an art in
itself. It is part art and part science. When beginning programming, you
need to familiarize yourself more with the scientific side of it, the
fundamental concepts and rules that comprise programming as a
discipline. The art can come later.

Learning the basics in programming means getting to grips with concepts
like values, variables, operators, expressions, conditionals, loops,
functions, and more. If you have no idea what any of these are, don't
worry. That's what this chapter is for.

We'll also cover the characteristics (including some of the
peculiarities) of JavaScript, our language of choice. JavaScript is a
powerful and enormously popular language; it is the only programming
language web browsers natively understand, so naturally enough, it is
*everywhere*. Learning JavaScript is therefore a very practical choice
and will serve you well in a lot of other areas besides generative art.

**Syntax**

We'll begin with some points on syntax.

Â© David Matthew 2024 19

D. Matthew, *Generative Art with JavaScript and SVG*, Design Thinking,
<https://doi.org/10.1007/979-8-8688-0086-3_2>

<h2>Case Sensitivity</h2>

JavaScript is a case-sensitive language, so the words JavaScript and
javascript would be considered distinct from one another. A
capitalization convention that many coders adhere to when naming
functions or variables is something called camel case, where terms are
joined together in a manner resembling the humps of a camel. For
example:

```
thisIsCamelCase soIsThis
```

As you can see, the first part of the term is entirely lowercase, and
all subsequent terms use what we'd call title case, where the first
character of the word is capitalized.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Spacing</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

Unlike some languages that enforce strict indentation, whitespace in
JavaScript doesn't carry any intrinsic meaning. Spacing is mostly a
matter of style. The most prevalent stylistic convention you'll come
across within the JavaScript community is the use of two spaces to
indent code, as follows:

```
someCode() { some indented code }
```

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Semicolons</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Each statement in JavaScript should end with a semicolon ( ; ), which is
the equivalent of a full stop in natural language. You can choose to
leave them out altogether, due to a JavaScript feature called Automatic
Semicolon Insertion (ASI), but because this isn't always safe to do (and
because I also work with other languages where semicolons are
mandatory), I opt to leave them in.

The code throughout this book will therefore use semicolons.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Comments</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
A very important habit to cultivate is the liberal use of comments in
any code you write. Not only so that others can more easily read and
understand your code, but so that *you* can do so too. You'd be amazed
at how quickly your own code can become conundrum-like without comments
to guide the way.

There are two types of comments in JavaScript: single-line comments and
multi-line comments. Single-line comments begin with two forward-
slashes //, and multi-line comments begin with a forward slash and
asterisk /\* and terminate with an asterisk and forward slash \*/.

// A single-line comment. Useful for quick explanations.

```
/* * A multi-line comment.
* Useful for properly documenting code.
*/
```

Single-line comments can also be placed after code on the same line.

```
someCode(); // We can safely write a comment here.
```

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
**Values**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
As a programmer, you've got to be well versed in values and their
various types. We're not talking moral values here or a programming code
of ethics; by values, we mean "chunks" of information that are
eventually boiled down to the bytes and bits that the computer
processes.

Values can be anything from numbers to strings of text (like "I love
breakfast cereals"). Let's start with numbers.

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Numbers</h2>

If computers love anything at all, it's numbers. They can crunch them
far faster than I can crunch through my favorite breakfast cereal. In
some programming languages, there are different types of numbers (e.g.,
int representing integers or whole numbers and float representing
decimal or floating-point numbers), but in JavaScript, all numeric
values are of the single type Number.

```
17 // A whole number.
23.085 // A decimal number. 
4e2 // A number with an exponent (four to the power of two in this case).
```

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Strings</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Strings represent textual information, like words and sentences. Strings
need to be surrounded by quote marks, of the single or double variety.

```
'There are 10 kinds of people in this world.' // Single quotes
"Those who understand binary and those who don't." //
```

Double quotes

Whether you choose to use single or double quotes, it's important to be
consistent with your choice. Try not to mix them haphazardly.

Another type of string exists called the template literal, which allows
you to insert variables and expressions into a string. This isn't
possible with standard single or double quotes. Template literals are
surrounded by backticks, and code can be inserted between curly braces
prepended by a dollar sign, like so:

```
`Some text here ${someCodeHere}, and more text here. Pretty cool huh?`
```

This is a more recent feature of JavaScript and is extremely useful for
handling concatenated (i.e., pieced together) and multi-line strings.
Let's illustrate this with an example.

```
// Here's how developers used to have to store multi-line HTML string data.
let oldWay = '' +
' <div class="intro">\n' + 'n' +
' <p>My name is ' + name + ' and I am ' + age + ' years of age.
</p>\n'
'n' + ' </div>\n';
// And here's how the same thing can be done now. let newWay = ` <div
class="intro"> <p>My name is ${name} and I am ${age} years of age.</p>
</div>`;
```

As you can see, it is much more readable and concise. As a rule,
whenever you want to mix string values with anything else, backticks are
the best choice.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Booleans</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Boolean values are binary; they can be either true or false. They are
named after George Boole, inventor of Boolean algebra.

They can be useful for representing any binary state: yes or no, on or
off, alive or dead, etc. They are written as simply true or false.
```
let alive = true; // phew let kicking = false; // just sitting
```
Booleans make conditional statements and comparisons possible, which
we'll get to a little later.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Empty Values</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Empty values are the final values we'll consider. There are two: null
and undefined. You can think of them as values that carry no
information. You'll see a lot of them (particularly undefined) when
debugging your code, so as you can imagine, they are not always the most
welcome of visitors.

What is the difference between null and undefined? A simplified way to
think of it is this: when JavaScript tells you a variable called x is
null, it's saying "yeah I know about x, but x doesn't have any value so
far as I can see." If, on the other hand, it tells you that x is
undefined, it is essentially saying "What the \*\*\*\* is x? Ain't no x around here."
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
**Variables**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
We've name-dropped variables a couple of times already, so what exactly
are they? You can think of variables like containers for values that can
be referenced later.

A variable needs to be declared before it can be used. There are three
ways to do this: using const, let, or var.

The latter, var, is no longer recommended; I mention it mainly for
historical reasons and because it is something you'll likely encounter
in the wild. Many, many JavaScript code bases out there still use var,
simply because prior to the great JavaScript update of 2015 (called
ECMAScript 6, or ES6 for short), there was no other options available.

Declaring a variable involves using the keyword, creating a name/
identifier, and then assigning it a value using the equals operator.

```
const name = 'David Matthew'; 
const countryOfBirth = 'Ireland'; 
let age = 21; // I wish!
```

What's the difference between const and let? When using const, you're
declaring a value that shouldn't change. My countryOfBirth is an
example: this is a historical fact that remains constant. If I later
tried to reassign a new value to countryOfBirth, this would result in an
error:

```
countryOfBirth = 'Brazil'; // uh oh...
-> TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
```

My age, however, is (alas) subject to change, so it can be updated
without any issues. Another difference between const and let is that the
latter can be declared without a value, whereas with const, a value must
be assigned to it when it is first created.

```
let a; // A-ok. 
const b; // asking for trouble.
-> Uncaught SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration
```

When unsure, should you use const or let? The general consensus in the
JavaScript community is that you should use const by default and only
use let when you think the variable may be assigned a new value later.
The reasoning is that this can reduce any unintended value
re-assignments, ruling out a potential source of bugs.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
**Operators**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
An operator is a symbol that performs operations on values. We've
actually come across one already: the assignment operator ( = ), which
assigns a value to a variable. Let's see what other kinds of operators
are available to us.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Arithmetic Operators</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
As you might have guessed, arithmetic operators allow us to perform
mathematical operations. The addition operator ( + ) allows us to add
numbers, but it also allows us to concatenate strings.

```
// Adding numbers.
2 + 2
-> 4

// Concatenating strings.
'I am' + ' so smrt'
-> 'I am so smrt'
```

There are also operators for subtraction ( - ), multiplication ( \* ),
and division ( / ).

```
// Subtracting numbers.
9 - 4
-> 5

// Dividing numbers.
9 / 4
-> 2.25

// Multiplying numbers.
9 * 4
-> 36
```

ES6 introduced an exponentiation operator ( \*\* ), which allows you to
multiply one number by a factor of another (i.e., one number to the
power of another).

```
// The exponentiation operator.
2 ** 2
-> 4

2 ** 6
-> 64

2.  ** 10
-> 1024
```

And finally, there is the modulo operator ( % ). This divides one number
by another and gives you the remainder. This can be especially useful
when cycling through arrays (which we'll get to later), or quickly
finding out if an unknown quantity is even or odd.

```
// The modulo operator in action.
3.  % 3
-> 0

3 % 2
-> 1

12 % 5
-> 2
```

At this point, it's worth mentioning rules of precedence, which
determine the order in which operations are carried out. The mnemonic
BEMDAS can help us out here.

-   **B**rackets: Whatever is in brackets or parentheses is evaluated
    first.

-   **E**xponents: Evaluate any exponents next.

-   **M**ultiplication and **D**ivision: Next, multipliers and divisors.
    These two have equal precedence, so they are evaluated in the order
    they are written, i.e., left to right.

-   **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction: Add and subtract any remaining
    numbers. As with multiplication and division, these have equal
    precedence and are evaluated left to right.

```
// These sums look similar but result in different answers.
4 / 2 * 2 + 4
-> 8

4 / 2 * (2 + 4)
-> 12

4 / 2 ** 2 + 4
-> 5
```

When in doubt, use parentheses to group operations. This can also
improve readability.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Comparison Operators</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
As the name suggests, comparison operators compare values. They always
return a boolean, that is, a true or false value.

-   \< is the "less than" operator.

-   \<= is the "less than or equal to" operator.

-   \> is the "more than" operator.

-   \>= is the "more than or equal to" operator.

-   == is the "equal to" operator.

-   === is the "strictly equal to" operator.

Because of some subtle quirks with how JavaScript works, I would
recommend sticking with the strict versions of the equality operators.
This can reduce unexpected surprises (i.e., bugs).

```
// Some examples of comparison operators in action.
1.  > 2
-> false

2.  < 3
-> true

3.  <= 4
-> true
5 == "5" -> true // but not really.
5 === "5" -> false // that's more like it.
```

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Logical Operators</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Lastly, there are the logical operators *and* ( && ), *or* ( \|\| ), and
*not* ( ! ). These emulate the conjunction, disjunction, and negation of
classical logic.

When conjoining two conditions with &&, the result is true if and only
if both conditions are true.

```
true && false -> false
false && true -> false
true && true -> true
```

When using the disjunction (fancy word for *or*), first make sure you
use the right characters on your keyboard. The \| character is not a
capital *i* or lowercase *L*; it's what's known as the pipe character.
Depending on your regional keyboard layout, it might be located near
either your Enter key or your Shift key.

When using \|\|, the result is true if one or both conditions are true.
This makes intuitive sense if we remember that we are essentially asking
the computer "is at least one of these conditions true?"

```
true || false -> true
false || true -> true
false || false
-> false
```

Finally, we have the negation operator !. This "flips" the condition
immediately following it. It can also be uniquely coupled with the
equality operator to mean not equal to ( !== ).

```
!true
-> false

!false
-> true

1 !== 2
-> true

!(2 > 1)
-> false
```

A common source of error for new programmers is using a single pipe
character \| or a single ampersand & instead of the two together. By
themselves, these characters perform bitwise operations (i.e., they
manipulate binary values) and are for advanced programming only.

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
**Conditional Statements**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

Now that we have comparative and logical operators under our belt, we
can proceed to conditionals. A conditional statement in JavaScript
allows us to influence a program's control flow. As an analogy, think of
rush hour traffic at a four-way intersection, the pavements packed with
pedestrians.

Without some way to control the flow of traffic, mayhem would ensue.
Here is where conditionals are needed, such as the various rules that
might underpin a traffic light system.

```
// The basic syntax. 
if (conditionIsTrue) { 
  // ... run some code
}
// A simplistic pedestrian crossing conditional. 
if (pedestrianBtnIsPressed) { 
  wait(30s); activateRedLights(); wait(3s);
  activateGreenManSignal(); 
}
```

To the basic if statement, we can append else and else if conditions too.

```
if (a > b) { 
  doThis();
} else if (a === b) { 
  doThat();
} else { 
  doOtherThing(); 
}
```

If a given condition isn't true, the code inside its curly braces
doesn't get executed. Let's take the preceding example again, with the
values filled in for a and b.

```
let a = 3; 
let b = 4;
if (a > b) { 
  doThis(); // condition wasn't true, so this code doesn't run. 
} else 
if (a === b) { 
  doThat(); // this code also doesn't run.
} else {
doOtherThing(); // both the above are false, so this code runs.
}
```

The last conditional form I want to cover is the ternary operator. As
its name suggests, it is technically an operator, but because it plays
the role of a conditional check, I felt it was more appropriate to
include it here.

```
// The basic structure of the ternary operator. 
conditionA ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;
```

In the aforementioned, we're asking "Is conditionA true? If so, run
expressionIfTrue. Otherwise, run expressionIfFalse."

The ternary operator is best used when you want to assign a value to a
variable based on whether a certain condition holds true. If that
condition doesn't hold true, we then assign it a different value. This
is exactly what I used it for in our first generative sketch:

```
const svgSize = window.innerWidth > window.innerHeight ?
window.innerHeight : window.innerWidth;
```

Here, we're saying "If the window's innerWidth is greater than its
innerHeight, assign the innerHeight to svgSize. Otherwise, assign to it
the innerWidth."

**Loops**

Loops are one of a programmer's superpowers. We're talking sea-parting,
earth-splitting powers. Or, at the very least, the ability to send your
programs spiralling toward infinity, potentially freezing any open
browser windows and spinning your CPU fan into a frenzy.

This is because loops can repeat blocks of code over and over, as many
times as we want, or indefinitely if needed. However, it's usually wise
to set a limit to looping behavior (infinite loops are more often an
error than an aim). We set a limit to a loop with what's called a
terminating condition, that is, a condition that tells the loop when to
stop.

We'll cover two main kinds of loops here: the while loop and the for
loop.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>The While Loop</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
The while loop is the simpler of the two. It's basic structure is as
follows:

```
while (condition === true) {
  // run code here while condition is true.
}
```

Now, if the condition in question *always* evaluates to true, that would
lead to an infinite loop. An important ingredient therefore in any
looping structure is a value that changes while the loop is running.
This is normally a number that either increments or decrements and is
known as an iterator. By convention, i tends to be used as the variable
name.

```
// Set up the iterator. 
let i = 0;
while (i <= 99) {
  // Write the value of i to the browser console.
  console.log(i);
  // Increment i by 1 each time the loop runs. 
  i = i + 1; 
}
```

The preceding loop will run 100 times, starting at 0 and continuing
until it is less than or equal to 99, and on each iteration, it will log
the value of i to the browser console. If we left out the code to
increment i, it would loop indefinitely.

It's worth noting at this point that there are shorthand ways of
incrementing and decrementing -- or indeed multiplying and dividing --
variable values:

```
// Long way. i = i + 1 i = i * 2 i = i -- 1 i = i / 2
// Shorter way.
i += 1 i *= 2 i -= 1 i /= 2
// Even shorter way (only valid for adding or subtracting by 1).
i++ i--
```

The shorthand notation is what you'll likely encounter in practice, so
we'll continue to use it here.

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>The For Loop</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
The for loop uses the same logic as our example while loop but bakes the
iterator and incrementation into a single line. Its typical structure is
as follows:

```
for (let i = startingNumber; i < upperLimit; i += increment) {
// run some code while i is less than the upperLimit.
}
```

The for loop structure is succinctly divided into three sections. We
first initialize the iterator, then set the terminating condition, and
then decide how we're going to vary the iterator. Here's the for loop
version of our previous example, where we logged the value of i to the
browser console on each iteration.

```
for (let i = 0; i <= 99; i++) { console.log(i); }
```

You don't always have to increment the iterator. You can just as easily
reverse the loop and have it count down from 99 to 0 by making a few
tweaks.

```
for (let i = 99; i >= 0; i--) { console.log(i); }
```

It is common to use the value of the iterator in the body of the for
loop in combination with other variables to achieve some dynamic result.
In our opening generative sketch for example, I used i to progressively
increase the radiusX and radiusY of each ellipse.

```
// Run a loop (a randomised number of times) to create our ellipses.
for (let i = 0; i < randomised.iterations; i += 1) {
// ... code.
let radiusX = 100 + (i * 3); let radiusY = 300 + (i * 2);
// ... more code.
}
```

There's lots more to love about loops, and other variations also exist
(such as the for in, the for of, and the forEach which we'll cover
later), but for the purposes of generative art, we'll be mainly
utilizing the standard for loop.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
**Functions**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Functions are fundamental to JavaScript as a language and are perhaps
the single most important concept we'll cover in this chapter. Functions
are self-contained blocks of code that perform a particular task. The
task is defined in the function body, and it might range from adding two
numbers together to initiating a rocket launch sequence.

Standard functions are defined using the function keyword followed by
the name you give it, which is then appended with parentheses and
opening and closing curly braces where the task is defined.

```
// Basic syntax of a standard function.
function peformSomeTask() {
// ... code defining the task.
}
```

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h3>Function Parameters</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Although functions are used in a wide variety of ways, their primary
purpose is to make code reusable. One way to do this is to add
parameters to the function, which are defined within the parentheses of
the function name.

```
// A function with parameters.
function sayHello(name) {

// Greet the user the Irish way. 
console.log(\`Howaya \${name}, what\'s the craic?\`); }
```

Functions may or may not explicitly return a value, and if they do, only
one return value is allowed. In the preceding example, a value isn't
returned, as that isn't the purpose of the function (or to get technical
about it, an undefined value would be returned if the function was
queried). In the following example, however, we are specifically looking
to get a value returned from the function, and this is where we use the
return keyword.

```
// Another function with parameters, this time returning a value.
function squareNumber(number) { return number * number; }
```

The preceding function, when called, will return the result we're
looking for, that is, the square of the number we supply it. But how do
we actually do this in practice?
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Invoking Functions</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
To use a function we've defined, we need to invoke it. This is
synonymous with calling or executing the function. It can be done like
so:

```
// Invoking a function. performSomeTask();
```

To invoke a function that has parameters as part of its definition, we
supply it with arguments. Arguments are the actual values we give the
function when we invoke it. The parameters, on the other hand, are how
we define these values. Let's see how we might invoke a function with arguments.

```
sayHello('Dave'); 
-> "Howaya Dave, what's the craic?"
console.log(squareNumber(4));
-> 16
```

Here, we've provided the argument \'Dave\' for the first function and 4
for the second, and we've received the expected output. But what if we
called the function and forgot the arguments? Let's try it out.

```
sayHello(); 
-> "Howaya undefined, what's the craic?"
squareNumber(); 
-> NaN
```

We've encountered undefined before, but not NaN. This just means "not a
number." In both cases, our functions don't work so well without
arguments. How might we fix this and make them a little more resilient?

One straightforward way is to assign default values when defining a
function's parameters. Let's rewrite our sayHello() function as an
example.

```
function sayHello(name = ", ah it's yourself") {
  // Greet the user the Irish way. 
  console.log(`Howaya \${name}, what's the craic?`); 
}
sayHello(); 
-> "Howaya, ah it's yourself, what's the craic?"
```

As you can see, creating a default value is as simple as assigning a
value to the parameter when you define it. Now we've created a more
human- sounding fallback than undefined.

In the case of the squareNumber() function, a default value doesn't make
as much sense. Instead, we could use the ternary technique covered
earlier to provide some actionable feedback if the function is called
without an argument.

```
function squareNumber(number) {
  return number ? number * number : 'Please include the number you want to square';
}
```

In the squareNumber() function body, our ternary operator is essentially
asking "Is number defined? If so, return the result of multiplying it by
itself; otherwise, return our fallback message."

At this point, you should be in a better position to fully understand
the function defined in our first generative sketch. Have another look
and see if it makes more sense now.

```
function random(min, max, integer = true) { 
  let random = Math.random() * (max - min) + min;
  let number = integer ? Math.floor(random) : random; return number; 
}
```

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
#  Scope
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
The scope of a variable refers to its visibility, or where in a program
the variable can be accessed. It's particularly important to be aware of
when working with functions.

If, for example, we defined a variable within a function, it would only
be visible within that function.

```
function scopeTest() { 
  const a = 1; }
    console.log(a);
    -> Uncaught ReferenceError: a is not defined
```

However, if we defined the same variable outside that function, it would
be visible from *within* the function.

```
const a = 1;
function scopeTest() { console.log(a); }
scopeTest(); -> 1
```

In the first case, the variable is block-scoped, that is, confined to
the block of the function. In the latter case, the variable is defined
globally (outside all functions) and can be accessed anywhere in the
program.

Although it may seem more beneficial to be able to access a variable
from anywhere within a program, we should exercise caution where global
variables are concerned. In general, it is better to explicitly restrict
the scope of our variables. This is one of the main reasons why var has
been deprecated, as it can't be "contained" in the same way that let and
const can be.

```
function scopeTest() { var a = 1; }
console.log(a); -> 1
```

As you can see earlier, when using var, the variable can break out of
the surrounding block, and this can be problematic in larger programs.

When coding generative art, we're usually writing relatively small
programs (or "sketches") and global variables aren't as much of an
issue. However, we'll discuss in the next section how best to make
certain settings globally available throughout our sketches without
relying on global variables.

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Anonymous Functions</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Functions don't always have to have a name. Particularly when working
with events and callbacks (which we'll cover in a later chapter),
functions are often called anonymously as function expressions, executed
in order to return a value. Anonymous functions can also be assigned to
variables that then store the returned value.

```
// An anonymous function expression assigned to a variable. const sum =
function(a, b) { return a + b; }
```

In the preceding example, the variable can be used to execute the
function.

```
sum(5, 4); -> 9
```

One thing we cannot do with anonymous functions is use them at the start
of a statement.

```
// The below is a no-no.
function(a, b) { return a + b;
}
-> Uncaught SyntaxError: Function statements require a function name
```

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Arrow Functions</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
So far we've covered functions declared with the function keyword, but
there is another, more modern way of writing functions. These functions
are called arrow functions due to the arrow syntax they employ.

```
// Basic syntax of an arrow function.
const peformSomeTask = () => { // ... code defining the task.
}
```

They are concise alternatives to the traditional function expressions
we've just covered. Let's rewrite the sum() function as an example.

```
const sum = (a, b) => { return a + b; }
```

A little shorter, as you can see. But it can get even more concise than
this if our function only consists of a single statement that returns a
value (which exactly describes our sum() function). In such a case, we
don't need the curly braces or even the return statement itself.

```
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
```

Because the arrow function body consists of just a single statement (
a + b ), it is assumed we want the value of this statement returned.
This is what's called an implicit return.

Now, not all arrow functions can be so neatly condensed, just those that
have a single return statement. But such one-liners are liberally used
throughout most modern JavaScript code bases, particularly those that
use declarative front-end frameworks like React, so it's worth
familiarizing yourself with them.

There is another reason to use arrow functions that stretches a little
beyond the scope of this chapter, and it's this. What I mean is the this
keyword, which is a complicated topic in JavaScript (and complicated to
explain without getting tangled in reflexive language). Suffice to say,
the value of this is more predictable and less prone to bugs when used
in arrow functions. But don't worry about this for now.

Instead, let's concern ourselves with some data structures that will
serve us well in generative art and in JavaScript more generally. This
is the subject of our next section.

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
**Objects and Arrays**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Variables are great when you need to define values like numbers,
strings, and booleans, but what if you need a more sophisticated way to
represent and organize your data? Say you have a long list of things --
be they this week's groceries, the employees in your company, the
locations you want to visit before you kick the proverbial bucket, or,
to bring it back to generative art, the hexadecimal codes of the 216
web-safe colors you'd like to sample for your next retro-inspired
masterpiece (in the 1990s, web developers -- or web masters as they were
then known -- had a much more restricted color palette).

When you have lists of anything, arrays are your friend.

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Arrays</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

An array is essentially a variable that can contain multiple values. And
in JavaScript, these values needn't be of a uniform type. This means we
can mix numbers, strings, and booleans into a single array if required
(though it's not necessarily recommended you do this). Arrays take the
following format:

```
// The syntax of a standard array. 
let arrayName = [item1, item2, item3, ... itemN];
```

Each array item has a corresponding index, or number, that represents
its position in the array. The first item in an array has an index of 0
(counting from zero in computing is the norm), the second item has an
index of 1, the third of 2, etc. To directly access an item in array by
its index, you use square bracket notation like so:

```
// Access the first item.
let firstItem = arrayName[0];

// Access the second item.
let secondItem = arrayName[1];

// Access the nth item.
let nthItem = arrayName[n + 1];
```

This lends itself particularly well to loops. Iterating over items in an
array with a for loop is a very common practice, and it's something
we'll lean on heavily throughout our generative art journey.

Let's continue with our web-safe colors example and iterate over an
array containing these 216 hexadecimal values.

You don't need to worry about how we get these items into the array for
now; all we're interested in is how we'd loop through them and take some
action for each item in the array. The action in this case will be to
set the color (i.e., fill ) of a newly created circle on each iteration.
And to make sure we do this 216 times, we use the length property of the
array to control how many times we run our loop.

```
for (let i = 0; 
i < webSafeColours.length; i += 1) {
  // ... some code.
  circle.fill(webSafeColours[i]);
  // ... more code.
}
```

In Figure 2-1, you'll see the output of this code snippet. Obviously
there's more involved in achieving this spiral arrangement (something
we'll cover in a later chapter); the main point is how we use the
iterator variable i to cycle through each color value, that is,
webSafeColours\[i\].

![](./images/image010.jpg){width="3.15in" height="3.15in"}

***Figure 2-1.** A web-safe color spiral*

If you're brave enough to inspect the code behind the example, you'll
notice that to add each color to the array initially, I used an array
method called push(). The relevant line is

```
colours.push(colour);
```

The push() method is how we add an item to the end of an array (think of
loading a truck from the back). If instead we wanted to add the item to
the beginning of the array, we'd use a method called unshift().

```
colours.unshift(colour);
```

If we wanted to remove an item from the end of the array, we'd use the
pop() method (think popcorn popping out of a pot). Conversely, if we
wanted to remove an item from the beginning of the array, we'd use the
shift() method (so-called because we're shifting all remaining items to
a lower index).

There's one other method I want to cover before moving on, namely, the
forEach() loop I mentioned earlier. This method is unique to arrays and
acts on each item of the array in turn, using a function as its
argument. As an aside, functions that are passed as arguments in this
manner are known as callback functions.

```
// Set up an sample array. 
const someNumbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];
// Call the forEach method on each array item.
someNumbers.forEach((item) => { 
  console.log(item * 2); 
});
-> 4 8 12 16 20
```

The forEach() loop can be a nice succinct way of iterating over an array
if the main purpose of the loop is to perform some action specifically
for each array item.

<h2>Objects</h2>

Objects are another data structure JavaScript offers, and like
functions, they are a foundational feature of the language. Take a peek
under the hood and you'll find objects everywhere. Functions are, in
fact, special kinds of objects.

Like arrays, objects can contain multiple values. The primary difference
is that objects label their values with names, whereas arrays label
their values with numbers (i.e., the index of each item). An object
takes the following format:

```
const objectName = { 
  name1: value1, name2: value2, name3: value3
};
```

These name-value pairs are the object's **properties**. The values can
be anything you want: strings, booleans, functions, arrays, or even
other objects. Almost anything you can think of can be represented as an
object. Let's take my laptop as an example.

```
const myLaptop = { 
  processor: "Core i5", 
  screenSize: "14 inches",
  inSleepMode: false, 
  powerUp: function() { 
    if (inSleepMode) { 
	  wakeUp();
    } 
	else { 
	  runBIOS();
    }
  }
  // etc
}
```

With these properties in place, we can call them with either bracket
notation, or -- more commonly -- dot notation.

```
// Accessing an object property with dot notation.
myComputer.screenSize;
-> "14 inches"

// Accessing via bracket notation.
myComputer[processor];
-> "Core i5"
```

We can also update and create new object properties via the same syntax.

```
// Updating an object's property. myComputer.inSleepMode = true;
// Creating a new object property. myComputer.storage = "512 GB SSD";
```

If you take a look back at our first sketch again, you'll notice that I
used an object to store some randomized settings that are later called
in the sketch:

```
...

const randomised = { 
  hue: random(0, 360), 
  rotation: random(-180, 180),
  iterations: random(10, 100) 
}
... let rotation = randomised.rotation + (i * 2);
```

This is a good way of getting around the issue of global variables I
mentioned earlier. Using an object, we can make our settings globally
available without relying on global variables. This can keep our code
tidier and less likely to cause conflicts.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
**Classes**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
A class is like a blueprint, or template, for creating objects. The
objects that are created are then said to be *instances* of that class.
A class can include both data and functions to work on that data. This
coupling of data and code is referred to as encapsulation.

We won't be going into much detail with classes, but it will be useful
to know some basic terminology, as the SvJs library we'll be using is
class based.

To create an instance of a class, we use the new keyword, followed by
the class name with brackets. This calls the class constructor.

```
// Defining a class.
class StarShip {
  ...
}
// Instantiating (or constructing) a class. 
const prometheus = new StarShip();
```

Functions that are part of a class are known as methods. A class will
usually have, at the very least, methods to get and set its properties.

```
prometheus.setDestination = 'Moon LV-223, Zeta 2 Reticuli';
prometheus.takeOff();
```

When we created our first generative SVG in Chapter 1, we began by
creating an SvJs class instance and calling some of its methods.

```
const svg = new SvJs();
svg.addTo(document.getElementById('container'));
```

This is the extent to which we will be working with classes; writing
them won't be part of this book.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
**Idiosyncrasies and Other Features**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
JavaScript offers plenty of other features, including closures, error
catching, proxies, promises, and more, but I can't cover them all here.
What I will point out here are some of the oddities -- or quirks if
we're being kinder -- associated with JavaScript that may confound
coders coming from another language.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Null and NaN Weirdness</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
We learned previously that null is essentially the absence of
information. Isn't it strange then that null is also considered an
object? We can confirm this by using the typeof check.

```
typeof null; -> object
```

Despite this, null is not considered an instance *of* an object. We can
confirm this by using the instanceof check.

```
null instanceof Object; -> false
```

NaN (not a number) also presents us with some quantum-level weirdness
that would have Schrodinger's cat perk up its ears. It is apparently not
a number but equal to a number at the same time. And, bizarrely, not
even equal to itself.

<pre>
typeof NaN; -> Number
NaN === Number;
-> false
NaN === NaN
-> false
</pre>

<h2>Secret Casting</h2>

JavaScript does some things behind the scenes that programmers from
stricter languages may not always appreciate. It is, for example,
notoriously loose with data types and will convert variables of
different types into matching types to suit the situation (the process
of converting a data type is also known as casting it). Let's play with
some numbers as an example.

```
1 == 1;
-> true
1 == "1";
-> true
```

How can a number equal a string? Well, it can't. JavaScript is casting
the string as a number to make sense of the expression. It is
essentially coercing the string data into number data (also known as
type coercion). That's why we're always better off using the strict
equality operator in JavaScript, something that doesn't exist in many
other languages.

```
1 === "1";
-> false
```

This kind of casting also occurs when we try to add numbers to strings,
but it works in the opposite direction; the numbers in this case are
converted to strings.

```
1 + "2";
-> "12"
"2" + 3;
-> "23"
```

To avoid the pitfalls of this kind of implicit type coercion, functions
like parseInt(), parseFloat(), and toString() can be used to re-cast or
explicitly convert variables to the data type you want to work with.

<h2>Semicolon Uncertainty</h2>

I mentioned at the start of the chapter that you can write JavaScript
without semicolons if you wish, but that in some edge cases, it can
result in unexpected behavior. Here's one such edge case.

```
return 1 + 2
-> undefined
```

Spacing doesn't matter in JavaScript, so what is going on here? Why
isn't the expression returning 3? Well, here the Automatic Semicolon
Insertion feature is being invoked under the hood. The actual code being
evaluated is this:

```
return; 1 + 2;
```

To avoid this, either familiarize yourself with such edge cases or just
use semicolons.

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
**Summary**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

We've covered a lot in this chapter:

-   Basic rules of JavaScript syntax

-   Values, such as strings, numbers, and booleans

-   Variables and the different ways to declare them

-   Arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators

-   Conditional statements and control flow

-   While loops, for loops, and forEach loops

-   Functions and scope

-   Arrays and array methods

-   Objects and object properties, and alternatives to global variables

-   Some of JavaScript's quirkier features

I've assumed next to no coding knowledge, so if that describes your
starting point and you've still kept up, well done!

In the next chapter, we'll explore the main functionality of the SvJs
library and get comfortable creating basic shapes, lines, and colors.

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h1 id="ch3">CHAPTER 3: All About SVG</h1>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
With the basics of JavaScript under your belt, you're now ready for
SvJs, which you can think of as your generative brush and palette.

In this chapter, we'll cover setting up our SVG canvas; how to work with
line and color; how to create a range of simple shapes; how to add text
and titles; how to define and reuse elements; how to use groups,
gradients, and patterns; and how the SVG viewBox and viewport work; and
in the process, we'll learn the core functions of the SvJs library and
how it relates to the SVG spec.

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
**The Parent SVG Element**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

Before we can create anything visually, we need to load our library and
set up the parent SVG element. The parent SVG, or the SVG document
fragment as it's also known, is that SVG element whose parent element
(if it has one) is not in the SVG namespace. An example would be an SVG
attached to an HTML DOM node.

```
<div id="container">
  <svg></svg>
</div>
```

This is worth mentioning only because SVGs can contain other SVGs; in
these cases, only one of those can be considered the parent SVG element.
You might also see this referred to as the root element.

Â© David Matthew 2024 55

D. Matthew, *Generative Art with JavaScript and SVG*, Design Thinking,
<https://doi.org/10.1007/979-8-8688-0086-3_3>

Let's reopen the JavaScript template file we set up in Chapter 1 (it
should be located in sketches/00-template/sketch.js) and add the
following line to it:

```
// Parent SVG. 
const svg = new SvJs();
```

The new SvJs() constructor, if called without any arguments, creates an
SVG element. It can also be used to create any other SVG element by
passing in the name of that element as a string.

```
// Using the SvJs constructor to create a circle element. 
const circle = new SvJs('circle');
```

To add our parent SVG element to our web page, we use the SvJs addTo()
method. In this case, we'll pass in the \<div\> with the id of container
that we set up earlier in our HTML (see Chapter 1). Add the following to
the template sketch:

```
const container = document.getElementById('container'); 
svg.addTo(container);
```

Most functions in SvJs are chainable, meaning you can chain them
together using dot notation, like so:

```
methodOne().methodTwo();
```

The new SvJs() constructor method is no exception, so our new parent SVG
element can actually be immediately attached to a DOM element once
instantiated, by appending the addTo() method to it. This creates a
method chain (think of the dot as the link). And if we pass the
getElementById() DOM method as an argument instead of assigning it to a
variable, we can condense our code down to a single line:

```
// Parent SVG. 
const svg = new SvJs().addTo(document.getElementById('container'));
```

Concision doesn't always beat clarity however, so if this one-liner is a
little too compressed for your liking, keep your template code as is, no
need to replace it with the aforementioned.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
**The Viewport and ViewBox**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
The viewport refers to the visible portion of our SVG element. It is
defined implicitly, via the use of width and height attributes.

One of the interesting things about the SVG format is its flexibility
with regard to its workspace, that is, the areas in which it can contain
content. An SVG may contain much more besides what is visible at any one
time through the viewport. This opens up the possibility of working with
sprites, artboards, and other offscreen assets.

Because we'll be working with a square SVG viewport, our width and
height will be the same, so we can use a single variable to store this
value. We'll call this svgSize. We don't know in advance what the screen
size or orientation will be, so hard-coding a value wouldn't be wise.
Instead, we can check the browser window dimensions by querying
window.innerWidth and window.innerHeight and set svgSize to the smaller
of the two values. This will ensure a square (or 1:1) aspect ratio. The
ternary operator that we covered in the previous chapter is particularly
useful for these kinds of checks. Include it as follows in the template
to initialize the svgSize variable:

```
// Viewport size (1:1 aspect ratio). 
const svgSize = window.innerWidth > window.innerHeight ? window.innerHeight : window.innerWidth;
```

The viewBox is another important top-level SVG attribute. It is related
to the viewport but has more powerful (and more complex) capabilities.
The viewBox allows us to define the position and dimensions of our
viewport in user space.

What does this mean exactly? Well, you can think of user space as
unitless, or unit-independent, space. A value of 100 might refer to
pixels, millimeters, meters, or any other unit. It will default to
pixels, but the point of the viewBox is that it can free us from
thinking in absolute units. We can work with our own internal coordinate
system without worrying about the actual dimensions of the device used
to render the SVG.

Personally, I like working with a width and height of 1000, as I find it
intuitive to divide up a canvas that way. Those 1000 units could later
be squeezed into a square 500px wide, or splashed across a billboard the
size of a bus.

The first two values of the viewBox define its starting coordinates
(known as min-x and min-y), and the second two define the width and
height. We'll keep things simple by defining the viewBox as 0 0 1000
1000.

If the viewport and viewBox don't share the same aspect (i.e., width to
height) ratio, the preserveAspectRatio attribute can be used to specify
how the browser should display the SVG. This can get complex quite
quickly, which is why I've already ensured our viewport and viewBox will
share the same 1:1 (i.e., square) aspect ratio. For now, just be aware
the preserveAspectRatio attribute exists, should you wish to facilitate
more elaborate setups in future.

Sometimes to best understand how something works, you need to visually
interact with it. With that in mind, I built a little CodePen sketch (or
"pen" as they're called) demonstrating the effect of adjusting the main
viewBox values, so you can see how they can be used together to scale
and

crop the content visible within the SVG viewport. You can find the pen at
[davidmatthew.ie/generative-art-javascript-svg#viewBox](https://davidmatthew.ie/generative-art-javascript-svg#viewBox)

At this point, we have the values we need for our viewBox and viewport,
but we haven't yet learned how to put them to use.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
**Setting and Getting Values**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Every SvJs instance, whether it's the parent SVG or one of its child
elements, has a set() method. This method allows us to set the values of
an element's attributes.

How do we know what attributes an element has? Well, we'd consult (i.e.,
google) some official documentation. The source I'd recommend is the
Mozilla Developer Network's SVG element reference, available at
[developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element)
Use it for reminders or for when you do your own independent
explorations. And while we're at it, the full documentation for the SvJs
library is available at
[npmjs.com/package/svjs](https://npmjs.com/package/svjs) (or at the
related GitHub repository); if you'd prefer, have that to hand for a
more structured definition of each method.

Getting back to setting values, the set() method accepts an object as
its argument and takes the following format:

```
svg.set({ attribute1: value1, attribute2: value2, attributeN: valueN )};
```

If you're setting a large number of properties at once, you might
consider adjusting the formatting for the sake of readability.

```
svg.set({ 
  attribute1: value1, attribute2: value2,
  ... 
  attributeN: valueN 
)};
```

It's up to you however; either way works.

The attributes of note for our parent SVG are the width and height
(which constitute the viewport) and the viewBox. We can now add the
following code to our template to set these attributes:

```
svg.set({ width: svgSize, height: svgSize, viewBox: '0 0 1000 1000'
});
```

If you run the live-server command and navigate to our template folder,
you'll just see a blank page at this point. This is because our SVG
canvas doesn't contain anything to distinguish it from the background.
We'll address this shortly by creating a rectangle to act as a
background layer/canvas.

Just as we can set() values, we can also get() them. It's unlikely
you'll find yourself doing this too often, but it's good to be aware the
functionality exists. The following code, for example, outputs our
viewBox value to the console:

```
console.log(svg.get('viewBox'));
```

Fetching attribute values via the get() method can be useful when
working with event listeners, or in other cases where the values are
being updated dynamically.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
**Quicker Element Creation**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
If we had to call the new SvJs constructor and the addTo method each
time we created a new SVG element, it might get a little tiresome after
a while. This is where the SvJs create() method comes in, as it combines
these two steps into one. To create an element and automatically append
it to our parent SVG, we'd simply write

```
svg.create('elementName');
```

When creating an element, it's usually best to assign it to a variable
in the process, unless you're sure you won't need a reference to it
again later. You might therefore write the aforementioned as

```
const variableName = svg.create('elementName');
```

The create() method is chainable and can be called by child elements
too.

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
**Lines and Shapes**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

The SVG spec defines six primitive shape types:

-   Circles

-   Ellipses

-   Lines

-   Polygons

-   Polylines

-   Rectangles

As we need to set up a background, let's start with the rectangle.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Rectangles and Squares</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
A rectangle is a rect in the SVG spec, so to create one, we'd write

```
svg.create('rect');
```

Next, we'll chain the set() method, focusing on the following five
attributes of the rect element: x and y to set the position of its top
left corner; width and height to define its size; and fill to define its
color.

As we want a square rectangle (as a square is technically just a special
kind of rectangle), we just need to set our width and height to the same
value. Add the following code to our template:

```
// Background.
svg.create('rect').set({ 
  x: 0, 
  y: 0, 
  width: 1000, 
  height: 1000, 
  fill: '#181818' });
```

Note that we're defining our background's position and dimensions
relative to the viewBox, not the viewport. This keeps our values
consistent, as we don't know in advance what size our viewport will be.
If you run live-server now, you should see a square canvas just a subtle
shade darker than the surrounding background.

This will suffice for our template. In case you've missed anything
earlier or just want to ensure your code is in order, here's the
template sketch.js file in full:

```
import { SvJs } from '../../node_modules/svjs/src/index.js';

// Parent SVG. const svg = new SvJs().addTo(document.
getElementById('container'));

// Viewport and viewBox (1:1 aspect ratio). 
  const svgSize =
  window.innerWidth > window.innerHeight ?
  window.innerHeight : window.innerWidth; 
svg.set({ 
  width: svgSize,
  height: svgSize, 
  viewBox: '0 0 1000 1000' 
});

// Background.
svg.create('rect').set({ 
  x: 0, 
  y: 0, 
  width: 1000, 
  height: 1000, 
  fill: '#181818'
});
```

Any further code we write will be specific to the sketch we're working
on. Make sure you've saved your changes before copying the 00-template
folder and its contents, renaming it to 02-basic-shapes.

<h2>First Strokes</h2>

There are two important attributes that can be used on practically every
graphical SVG element (i.e., elements that are intended to appear on
screen). These are an element's fill and stroke. As we've already seen,
the fill defines an element's interior color (or background). The
stroke, on the other hand, defines the color of an element's outline (or
border).

If you don't define a stroke, none will appear. And if you do define
one, its stroke-width will default to 1. The stroke-width attribute is
important to highlight for another reason: it's an example of a
hyphenated attribute. We can't use hyphens when setting attributes in
JavaScript, as they will be interpreted as subtraction operators.

We have two options to deal with this: we can turn them into strings,
that is, write \'stroke-width\' instead of stroke-width, or we can
replace hyphens with underscores, that is, stroke-width becomes
stroke_width. The latter option is facilitated by SvJs, and it's the
solution I prefer; it's faster and looks less out of place than having
stringified object properties mixed with others that aren't strings.

Enough with the theory for now -- let's create something! The following
sketch is a Josef Albers--inspired color illusion and shows that with
just plain rectangles, it's possible to create a somewhat interesting
composition (illustrated in Figure 3-1).

```
import { SvJs } from '../../node_modules/svjs/src/index.js';

// Viewport size (1:1 aspect ratio). 
const svgSize = window.innerWidth > window.innerHeight 
  ? window.innerHeight : window.innerWidth;

// Parent SVG. 
const svg = new SvJs().addTo(document.getElementById('container')); 
svg.set({ 
  width: svgSize, 
  height: svgSize, 
  viewBox: '0 0 1000 1000' 
});

// Background.
svg.create('rect').set({ 
  x: 0, 
  y: 0, 
  width: 1000, 
  height: 1000, 
  fill: '#181818' 
});

// Main orange square. 
svg.create('rect').set({ 
  x: 150, 
  y: 200, 
  width: 700, 
  height: 600, 
  rx: 15, 
  fill: '#e56411', 
  stroke: '#fff', 
  stroke_width: 30, 
  paint_order: 'stroke'
});

// Blue rectangle.
svg.create('rect').set({ 
  x: 650, 
  y: 200, 
  width: 200, 
  height: 600, 
  rx: 15, 
  fill: '#69969f'
});

// Smaller orange rectangle. 
svg.create('rect').set({ 
  x: 200, 
  y: 425,
  width: 600, 
  height: 150, 
  rx: 20, 
  fill: '#b84b08'
});

// Yellow rectangle. 
svg.create('rect').set({ 
  x: 325, 
  y: 200, 
  width: 175, 
  height: 600, 
  fill: '#fed322'
});

// Purple rectangle.
svg.create('rect').set({ 
  x: 500, 
  y: 200, 
  width: 175, height: 600,
  fill: '#49283c\' });
```

![](./images/image011.jpg){width="3.15in" height="3.15in"}

***Figure 3-1.** A Josef Albers--inspired color illusion*

Do the smaller rectangles on the right and left look like the same shade
of orange? Assuming this illusion was successful, you might have some
trouble settling on a definite answer. But by browsing the code, you can
easily verify that they are not only the same shade, but the same shape!

What gives the rectangles those rounded corners is the rx attribute,
which means its radius on the x axis. If the corresponding ry attribute
isn't defined, it's assumed you want the same value (resulting in a
uniformly curved corner).

You also might have spotted another hyphenated attribute in the
preceding code, namely, paint-order. This determines in what order our
fill and stroke are rendered for a given element.

The default order has fill come first (i.e., the fill is beneath so it
will get partly painted over by the stroke), but sometimes it can be
useful to have stroke come first, as only then will we see the full fill
dimensions painted (remove paint_order: \'stroke\' from the code and
you'll see what I mean).
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Circles and Ellipses</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
The circle is the simplest (and arguably the most perfect) of all
shapes. We define the position of its center via cx and cy attributes
and its radius via the r attribute.

```
// A simple circle example. 
svg.create('circle').set({ 
  cx: 50, 
  cy: 50,
  r: 25 });
```

In the next sketch, let's shift things up a gear with a for loop. We're
going to play with the effect of layering semitransparent circles of
different sizes over each other (shown in Figure 3-2). Copy our template
folder again and rename it to 03-circle-overlay-loop or something
similar (the names of our folders don't really matter provided we
maintain a modicum of organization).

Beneath where we defined our background, include the following code:

```
// Circle overlay loop. 
for (let i = 1; 
i <= 6; i += 1) {

  // Vary the radius, and the two vertical centre points.
  let r = 50 * i; 
  let cx = 500; 
  let cy1 = 800 - r; 
  let cy2 = 200 + r; 
  
  // Create the blueish circle set.
  svg.create('circle').set({ 
    cx: cx, 
	cy: cy1, 
	r: r, 
	fill: '#99eeff',
    fill_opacity: 0.1 
  });

  // Create the greenish circle set.
  svg.create('circle').set({ 
    cx: cx, 
	cy: cy2, 
	r: r, 
	fill: '#aaffee', 
	fill_opacity: 0.1
  });
}

// Create a subtle outline. 
svg.create('circle').set({ 
  cx: 500, 
  cy: 500, 
  r: 320, 
  fill: 'none', 
  stroke: '#aaffee', 
  stroke_width: 2,
  stroke_opacity: 0.1 
});
```

![](./images/image012.jpg){width="3.15in" height="3.15in"}

***Figure 3-2.** The result of our circle overlay loop*

What we've done here is vary the vertical position of the cy attribute
and increase the radius r for two sets of circles each time the loop
runs. The circle sets are differentiated by their color (slightly) and
initial positions. A final circle outside the loop provides a subtle
outline to frame the circle sets.

Ellipses are similar to circles but offer two radii attributes -- rx and
ry -- instead of the single r. In the first generative sketch from
Chapter 1, we saw the ellipse in action. Here's the relevant snippet:

```
// Create our ellipse. 
let ellipse = svg.create('ellipse');
ellipse.set({ 
  cx: center, 
  cy: center, 
  rx: radiusX, 
  ry: radiusY,
  ...
});
```

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Lines, Polylines, and Polygons</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

If you need to draw a simple straight line from one point to another,
you'd use the line element. It requires two sets of coordinates: x1 and
y1 to define the initial position and x2 and y2 to define the endpoint.
It also requires the stroke to be defined (as it is a line after all).

```
// The humble line.
svg.create('line').set({ 
  x1: 10, 
  y1: 10, 
  x2: 90, 
  y2: 90, 
  stroke: '#333'
});
```

This is a good opportunity to showcase some other stroke-related
attributes that can alter the appearance of a line. The first is stroke-
linecap. This defines how the endpoints of a line behave. The default
value, butt, limits the line length to its endpoints. A value of round
will close off the line with a semi-circle at each end, whereas a value
of square will close it off with -- you guessed it -- a square. Figure
3-3 shows the different values, with vertical lines on either side to
delineate where the values come into effect.

![](./images/image013.jpg){width="3.15in" height="1.575in"}

***Figure 3-3.** Values of butt, round, and square (top to bottom)*

The other attribute I want to highlight is stroke-dasharray. If, rather
than a solid line, you would prefer a stroke consisting of dashes, this
is what you would use. More specifically, the stroke-dasharray sets the
pattern of dashes -- and the gaps between them -- with which to paint a
stroke.

If we set a single value, say 20, that value will be used for the length
of the dash and the length of the gap. If we set two values, the first
is used for the dash and the second for the gap. If however we set three
values, the first is used for the dash, the second for the gap, and the
third for the next dash. The values are then cycled through again,
creating a repeating pattern.

There isn't a strict upper limit on the amount of values you provide, so
there is scope to get quite creative here.

```
// Setting an irregular stroke-dasharray.
svg.create('line').set({
  ... stroke_dasharray: 10 30 60 });
```

In Figure 3-4, from top to bottom, we see the following stroke-
dasharray values (all relative to a viewBox width of 1000):

-   20

-   40 20

-   10 30 60

-   50 100 200 100

![](./images/image014.jpg){width="3.15in" height="1.575in"}

***Figure 3-4.** Various stroke-dasharray values*

If you want to connect one straight line to another, you'd use a
polyline element. This takes a points array of space-separated (or
comma-separated) values to define each x and y coordinate. The array of
points needs to be converted to a string before being set as the
attribute value. I show how to do this in the following example using
the join() array method. The result is shown in Figure 3-5.

```
// An array of points. let pointsArray = [
  100, 250, 250, 250, 285, 175, 325, 325, 390, 50, 450, 400, 500, 200,
  515, 250, 900, 250
];

// A polyline element, mimicking a heartbeat.
svg.create('polyline').set({ 
  points: pointsArray.join(' '), 
  stroke: '#6df876', 
  fill: 'none', 
  stroke_width: 10, 
  stroke_linecap: 'round', 
  stroke_linejoin: 'round'
});
```

![](./images/image015.jpg){width="3.15in" height="1.575in"}

***Figure 3-5.** A polyline element in action*

I've also used the stroke-linejoin attribute in the preceding example;
this defines the shape to use at point where each line meets the next.

A polygon element is similar to a polyline element but is used for
closed shapes, that is, where the start and end points connect. In
Figure 3-6, we see an arrangement of polygons that might be familiar to
gamers of a particular platform.

![](./images/image016.jpg){width="3.15in" height="1.575in"}

***Figure 3-6.** Polygons for the players*

Manually creating shapes with either the polygon or polyline elements
isn't something we'll focus further on for now, as it can be quite
tedious.

There are better ways to generate shapes that we'll cover in a later
chapter.

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
**Text and Titles**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

As SVG is a plain text format, it's no surprise that it supports textual
elements. To create some text, we use the usual svg.create() method. At
a minimum, we need to define the x and y coordinates of where we want it
to appear (relative to the bottom left corner of the text's bounding
box), its color, and its content.

```
// Creating text. 
let text = svg.create('text').set({ 
  x: 20, 
  y: 30,
  fill: 'white' 
});
```

So how do we define the textual content if the content isn't itself an
attribute? It's not a child node either, so creating a string and
appending it wouldn't work. Instead, what we need to do is use the SvJs
content() method.

```
// Using the content() method to insert text.
text.content('I have an unhealthy obsession with SVG.');
```

What if we wanted to get a bit more elaborate with our text and style
them with some web fonts? There are a few ways we could do this, but
I'll stick with the simplest and pull in some Google fonts via our HTML.
Let's use this as the basis of a quick sketch; copy our 00-template
folder and call it 04-chalkboard-gag.

If you've ever watched *The Simpsons*, you'll know that the beginning of
most episodes features a chalkboard gag, where Bart is shown scrawling
lines on a chalkboard as punishment for his errant behavior. One of my
favorites is featured in the following sketch.

What we need to do first is include the following \<link\> in our HTML,
so switch over to the index.html file and add the following line to the
\<head\> section. This calls in a Google font called Mynerve, which has
the handwritten look we're going for.

```
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Mynerve
&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

If Bart had the option of running a for loop to minimize the repetitive
nature of his punishment, I'm sure he would have taken it. Let's do this
on his behalf (and cheat Skinner out of some satisfaction).

Add the following code below where we declare our background. Some
points to note: we're calling the toUpperCase() string method to
capitalize the content; this is a useful method to know, as is the
related toLowerCase() method. The font_size of 52 is used to optimally
fill the viewBox width, and incrementing the y position on each
iteration by 80 is what pushes the lines down our chalkboard. We have
enough space to do this 12 times, which is why we limit incrementation
to below 960 (960 Ã· 80 = 12). Another iteration would overflow the
viewport.

The output is shown in Figure 3-7.

```
// The line to use for the gag. 
let line = '"Bart Bucks" are not legal tender.'; 
  line = line.toUpperCase();
  // Run a loop, creating 12 (960 / 80) lines of text.
  for (let i = 0; i < 960; i += 80) { 
    let text = svg.create('text');
    text.content(line); 
	text.set({ 
	  x: 20, 
	  y: 80 + i, 
	  fill: '#fff',
      font_size: 52, 
	  font_family: 'Mynerve'
    });
  }
```

![](./images/image017.jpg){width="3.15in" height="3.15in"}

***Figure 3-7.** The "Bart Bucks" chalkboard gag*

Titles are another type of text we can use. Unlike a text element, a
title element doesn't need to be positioned; it is intended to be nested
within an element as a description. It works in the same way an HTML
title attribute works; it helps with accessibility and appears as a
tooltip on hover. It can be used to title the parent SVG element, or any
of its child elements.

```
// Create a title for a circle element.
let circle = svg.create('circle'); let circleTitle =
circle.create('title'); circleTitle. content('I get around-round, I
get around.');
```

A title element is suitable for shorter descriptions; for more extended
descriptions, the desc element is recommended. This doesn't render and
is purely for accessibility purposes, and is created in exactly the same
way as a title element.

If you want to add extra information about the SVG file itself, the
metadata element can be used. An example would be embedding RDF
(Resource Description Framework) data, or application-specific data.
You'll often see software like Inkscape or Illustrator embed their own
metadata in this manner.

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
**Definitions**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

If we want to define a graphical or other container element for use in
our SVG but don't want that element itself to appear (or if we want it
to appear only when referenced), we would nest in within the defs
element, which stands for definitions. The defs element can improve the
overall accessibility of an SVG and also better help organize its
content.

We'll rely on the functionality provided by the defs element in the
upcoming sections on gradients, patterns, and other reusable elements.

```
// Defining a defs element. 
let defs = svg.create('defs');
```

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
**Gradients**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

A gradient is a gradual transition from one color state to another. In
SVG, gradients can support a multitude of these different color states
(or "stops" as they're called). Most often, you'll see gradients of the
two-stop variety, but occasionally you'll come across one boasting a
rainbow-esque array of different colors. And speaking of rainbows, the
sky itself is a great source of gradient inspiration
(gradienspiration?). Think of the dim light at dusk where soft yellows
transition to light blues, or the brilliant blaze of a sunset where
purples, reds, and oranges collide.

Gradients can be of two varieties: linear (a color transition that
proceeds from one area to another in a straight line) and radial (a
color transition that emanates outward in all directions from a focal
point).

How would we create such gradients in SvJs? It turns out it would be a
very verbose process using just the create() method, and there's a
couple of reasons for this:

-   Gradients are defined as stand-alone elements within the defs
    section rather than treated as purely presentational element
    attributes. The upside of this is that a single gradient can be
    shared among multiple elements, but the downside is we've got a
    couple of extra steps to begin with.

-   For each gradient color, a stop element must be defined and nested
    within the gradient element to define the color and its offset (or
    position). This adds another series of steps.

To remedy the aforementioned, SvJs offers a dedicated createGradient()
method that significantly speeds up the process of constructing a
gradient. Its syntax is as follows:

```
createGradient(id, type, colours, rotation)
```

With the first argument, we assign an id to the gradient so that it can
be referenced or called upon later by an element. With the second
argument, we specify the gradient type, that is, linear or radial. With
the third argument, we pass in an array of color values. And with the
final argument, we specify the angle of rotation, which is 45Â° by
default (meaning it "shines" from the top left to the bottom right).
This last argument is optional and is only applicable to gradients of
the linear variety.

The createGradient() method can only be called by the parent SVG, as
behind the scenes it checks whether a defs element is already defined
within the SVG, and if not, it creates it and appends the gradient to
it.

Here's how we might create a simple three-stop linear gradient and apply
it to a rect element.

```
// Create the gradient with an id of 'grad'.
svg.createGradient('grad', 'linear', ['red', 'orange', 'yellow'], 90);

// Apply the gradient to the fill of the rect via a url reference.
svg.create('rect').set({ 
  x: 0, 
  y: 0, 
  width: 400, 
  height: 400, 
  fill: 'url(#grad)' });
```

As you can see, the shape we want the gradient applied to references the
gradient id as an internal url. In the preceding example, we've applied
it to the fill attribute, but it could also have been applied to the
stroke.

In Figure 3-8, we see an example of three linear gradients and their
radial equivalents. The first gradient has two color stops, the second
has three, and the third has four. As you can see, it's easier to make
linear gradients look smoother; with radial gradients, subtlety is
always better, as transitions can seem relatively abrupt (or banded)
compared to their linear counterparts.

![](./images/image018.jpg){width="3.15in" height="3.15in"}

***Figure 3-8.** Linear gradients and their radial equivalents*

There are more ways to customize gradients that we won't get into here,
but if you're interested, check out the MDN documentation for more on
the gradient spreadMethod and varying the focal points of radial
gradients.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
**Patterns**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Like gradients, patterns reside in the defs element to be referenced
later rather than rendered directly. They have their own viewport (i.e.,
width and height) and optional viewBox, which can seem a little
complicated at first, but it does allow for a greater degree of
flexibility. Think of a pattern element as a miniature canvas to be
replicated across a larger graphical element and these settings will
make more sense.

To create a pattern, we can use the createPattern() shortcut method,
which, as with the gradient method, automatically appends itself to a
defs element and creates one if it doesn't exist. It also simplifies
pattern creation in other ways under the hood that you don't have to
worry about. It requires three arguments: the pattern id, the width, and
the height.

To show how patterns work, we'll create a quick sketch -- another
optical illusion, but this time the focus won't be on the colors. Copy
our 00-template folder and rename it to 05-optical-illusion.

In our sketch.js file below the code for the background, create a
pattern with an id of 'illusion' and with a width of 100 and a height of
200.

```
// Create our pattern. 
const pattern = svg.createPattern('illusion', 100, 200);
```

This simply initializes our pattern; we haven't placed anything within
it yet, nor have we set up a shape to apply it to. We just have a
pattern in the shape of a vertical rectangle.

In our first iteration of this sketch, I'll show you how a simple
pattern gets applied to a shape. We'll get more elaborate with the
pattern content afterward. Add the following code to our sketch:

```
// Create a white rectangle within the pattern.
pattern.create('rect').set({ 
  x: 10, 
  y: 10, 
  width: 80, 
  height: 180, 
  fill: '#eee' 
});
```

Now that we have our simple pattern in place (consisting of a single
white rectangle), it's time to apply it to a shape. For simplicity,
let's apply it to another rect the full size of the SVG viewBox, like
so:

```
// Apply our pattern to a rect the size of the viewBox.
svg.create('rect').set({ 
  x: 0, 
  y: 0, 
  width: 1000, 
  height: 1000, 
  fill: 'url(#illusion)'
});
```

You should now see something similar to Figure 3-9. Not especially
interesting, but sufficient to showcase the basics.

![](./images/image019.jpg){width="3.17in" height="3.17in"}

***Figure 3-9.** A basic pattern*

In the next few steps, we'll create our optical illusion. First, comment
out the code that created the white rectangle pattern (but keep the
shape it's applied to).

```
// Create our pattern. 
const pattern = svg.createPattern('illusion', 100, 200);

// Create a white rectangle within the pattern.
// pattern.create('rect').set({
// x: 5, y: 5, width: 90, height: 190, fill: '#eee'
// }); // We'll place our new code here. 
// Apply our pattern to a rect the size of the viewBox. 
svg.create('rect').set({ 
  x: 0, 
  y: 0, 
  width: 1000, 
  height: 1000, 
  fill: 'url(#illusion)' 
});
```

To create the base of our optical illusion, we need a total of eight
rectangles. Four of them will be white squares arranged in a particular
order, and four will be thin gray rectangles used as separators. We'll
use a couple of for loops to create these. First, the white squares:

```
// Create 4 x white squares within the pattern.
for (let i = 0; 
  i < 4; i += 1) { 
    pattern.create('rect').set({ 
      x: (i === 3) ? 20: i * 20, y: i * 50, width: 50, height: 50, fill: '#eee'
    });
  }
```

The width, height, and fill merely repeat themselves on each iteration;
the only attributes we're varying are the x and y coordinates. To do
this, we're using the changing value of the i iterator. The y coordinate
increases by 50 on each run, which is simple enough. The expression
defining the x position is a little more complicated. What we're saying
here is that we want x to increase by 20 on each iteration, *except* for
the final one (where i === 3). For this, we want to set it to 20.

If you view the pattern at this point, you should see an undulating
array of squares. It's not an optical illusion yet; it looks more like
rudimentary pixel art. To complete the illusion, we need our separators.

```
// Create 4 x thin grey rectangles to separate the squares.
for (let i = 0; i < 4; i += 1) { pattern.create('rect').set({ x: 0,
y: 45 + (i * 50), width: 100, height: 5, fill: '#666'
});
}
```

Now when you hit save, you should see something like Figure 3-10.

![](./images/image020.jpg){width="3.15in" height="3.15in"}

***Figure 3-10.** A repeating pattern creating an optical illusion*

If the illusion worked, the gray lines should appear slightly slanted,
particularly those you're not directly focusing on. Hopefully this will
give you some sense of the power of patterns! We've touched on the main
points, but they can be customized extensively with further parameters
if needed.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
**Grouping and Reusing Elements**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Grouping elements together can be done with the g element. There are a
number of use cases for this. One, which applications like Inkscape have
adopted, is to use the g element to support layer functionality. Another
is to group elements together for the purposes of transformation (i.e.,
moving, rotating, or skewing multiple elements at once). And another is
to simply group items together to better organize your SVG.

```
// Create a circle and add it to a group.
const circle = svg.create('circle'); 
const group = svg.create('g');
circle.addTo(group);
```

If you want to group elements together for later reuse (so that they are
only displayed when referenced), you'd use the symbol element. Symbols,
like patterns, can have their own viewport and viewBox. But they are
called via the use element rather than applied to a fill or stroke.

```
// Create a symbol consisting of a circle and square. 
const symbol = svg.create('symbol'); 
symbol.set({ 
  id: 'mySymbol', 
  width: 100,
  height: 100 {); 
  symbol.create('circle').set({ ... });
  symbol.create('rect').set({ ... });

// Using the symbol three times but varying its co-ordinates.
svg.create('use').set({ href: '#mySymbol', x: 0, y: 0 });
svg.create('use').set({ href: '#mySymbol', x: 200, y: 200 });
svg.create('use').set({ href: '#mySymbol', x: 400, y: 400 });
```

Symbols don't have quite the same appeal outside of a declarative
context, so going forward we won't be relying on them for our
imperative- based creations. But there's plenty more to unpack if you
want to explore further on MDN.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
**Summary**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

To recap, we've covered the following in this chapter:

-   The core functions provided by the SvJs library

-   How the SVG viewBox and viewport work

-   Creating basic shapes like rectangles, circles, ellipses, polylines,
    and polygons

-   Customizing stroke behavior and appearance

-   Working with text and titles

-   Creating gradients and patterns

-   How definitions, groups, and symbols allow us to reuse elements and
    better structure our SVG

In the next chapter, we'll explore how we can combine regularity with
randomness to create truly generative compositions.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
**CHAPTER 4**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
**Randomness and Regularity**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
So far, all of our sketches (bar the first one) have lacked a certain
ingredient usually considered foundational to the very genre of
generative art:

namely, randomness. When we surrender full control over the result of
our sketches and leave certain elements to chance, it allows for
variation, for exploration, and for *discovery*.

In this chapter, we'll learn how to randomize parameters like colors,
sizes, and coordinates; how to randomly pick from predefined ranges and
arrays; and how to work with different probability distributions. We'll
also cover a popular generative technique that involves constructing
regular grids and randomizing their contents. We'll then learn how to
apply randomness to the construction of the grids themselves so that the
underlying structure of our compositions can be varied.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
**Analogue and Digital Randomness**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Techniques to incorporate randomness into art began long before the
digital age. As far back as the fifteenth century, Leonardo da Vinci
suggested that artists take inspiration from sources rich in random and
suggestive detail, such as the arbitrary forms found on the surface of
stained stones and dirty walls. Artists like Max Ernst took such prompts

Â© David Matthew 2024 85

D. Matthew, *Generative Art with JavaScript and SVG*, Design Thinking,
<https://doi.org/10.1007/979-8-8688-0086-3_4>

quite literally; his frottage technique was borne of dropping paper at
random on floorboards full of scrapes and scratches and making charcoal
rubbings from the textures.

Contemporaries of Ernst, the early twentieth-century surrealists, also
played with randomness. They developed a technique known as automatism,
which aimed to eradicate full conscious control over an artwork's
execution, allowing chance and the unconscious to act as the primary
driving forces.

These examples, however, all draw upon the randomness found in the
analogue world. In the more deterministic world of the digital, where
ones and zeros reign, true randomness is harder to find. It must instead
be simulated.

The good news is that this is more of an academic point than a practical
obstacle. Simulated randomness (or pseudo-randomness as it's referred to
in the field of computer science) is more than enough for our needs. And
it's very easy to demonstrate this too, thanks to JavaScript's built-in
Math.random() function. Typing the function into your browser console
and hitting return should provide sufficient assurance that the
17-decimal floating-point number it throws back at you is unlikely to
repeat itself anytime soon. Random enough, right?

```
Math.random();
-> 0.32846662956382255
```

The limitation of this function is that it only returns a number between
0 and 1. Granted, we can easily multiply the output by whatever factor
we want, but what if we needed a number within a specific range? Or
wanted to choose an item at random from an array?

<h2>The SvJs Gen.random( ) Function</h2>

Thankfully the SvJs library comes armed with some extras: specifically,
an optional module called Gen that contains a number of useful functions
for generative artists. One of these is the Gen.random() function.

To load the Gen module, we need to add it to our import statement at the
top of our sketches. Modify the template sketch to include this as the
first line (replacing the previous import statement):

```
import { SvJs, Gen } from '../../node_modules/svjs/src/ index.js';
```

Now we can call Gen.random() and any of the other Gen methods

(more of which we'll cover later). When called without any arguments,
Gen.random() behaves just like Math.random(); it returns a
floating-point number between 0 and 1.

```
Gen.random();
-> 0.5682831319665758
```

If, however, we supply some arguments, it suddenly becomes a lot more
useful. Here are some examples:

```
// Return an integer between 50 and 100.
Gen.random(50, 100);
-> 87

// Return a floating point number between 10 and 20.
Gen.random(10, 20, true);
-> 17.98188644344106
// Return a random item from an array. let rainbow = ['red',
'yellow', 'pink', 'green', 'purple',
'orange', 'blue'];
Gen.random(rainbow);
-> 'purple'
```

As you can see, if we provide two numbers, the Gen.random() function
will treat them as the lower and upper thresholds of a range and return
a number within that range. An integer is returned by default, but if we
set the third argument to true, it will return a floating-point number.
It will also return a floating-point number if we supply no arguments at
all (as in our first example), or if the difference between the first
and second arguments is less than or equal to one.

If we pass in an array as the sole argument, an item is randomly
selected from that array. I purposely used colors in the example
(apologies if the "Sing a Rainbow" song got stuck in your head), as this
functionality is particularly useful when selecting colors from a
predefined palette.

**Elements Everywhere All at Once**

Let's create a sketch and put Gen.random() to work. Copy the 00-template
file as we usually do and rename it to something like 06-elements-
everywhere.

Below our background code, initialize a variable to store a random
iteration count, which will determine how many times our for loop (which
we'll set up after) will run.

```
let iterations = Gen.random(500, 1000);
```

Our iterations will be an integer anywhere between 500 and 1000. With
that in place, let's write the loop. We'll keep it simple initially and
just use it to create small circles. Each circle will be given a random
position within the dimensions of the viewBox (0 to 1000), and its
radius will be between 1 and 10. This should create an effect not too
dissimilar to the spattering of paint (illustrated in Figure 4-1).

```
for (let i = 0; i \< iterations; i += 1) { svg.create(\'circle\').set({
cx: Gen.random(0, 1000),
cy: Gen.random(0, 1000), r: Gen.random(1, 10)
});
}
```

![](./images/image021.jpg){width="3.15in" height="3.15in"}

***Figure 4-1.** A random spattering of circles*

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Varying Color and Opacity</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

At this point, we have colorless spatters randomly speckling the canvas.
Let's change this up by varying the hue and opacity of the fill. We'll
do this with the hsl() function, which is something we'll be drawing
upon quite a lot. Its syntax is as follows:

```
hsl(hue saturation lightness / alpha)
```

The hue can be any number between 0 and 360. The saturation and
lightness are percentage values, and the alpha component (which
determines the opacity) can be either a percentage or a number between 0
and 1.

In our loop, add the following line below the radius (making sure to
separate the lines with a comma):

```
fill: \`hsl(\${Gen.random(0, 360)} 80% 80% / \${Gen. random(5, 40)}%)\`
```

Now our speckles have come a little more to life (see Figure 4-2). But
why stick to circles? Why not throw some other elements into the mix and
make it look a little less like a cosmic ball pit? In the next version
of the sketch, we'll do precisely that. The complexity will ramp up
considerably, so we'll step through it slowly.

<h2>Varying Element Selection</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

Below our iterations variable, create an array called elements and
populate it with a circle, a line, and a rect: let elements =
\[\'circle\', \'line\', \'rect\'\];

Next, delete all the existing code in our for loop, and replace it with
the following line that will pick a random element from the elements
array defined previously.

```
// Pick a random element. let element = Gen.random(elements);
```

In the next step, we'll initialize some variables with random values
that we can later apply to our randomly selected element. In addition to
our x, y, and fill, we'll also vary our stroke and stroke-width.

```
// Set up variables that we can use on any element.
let x = Gen.random(200, 800); 
let y = Gen.random(200, 800); 
let fill = `hsl(${Gen.random(120, 240)} 80% 80% / ${Gen.random(5, 40)}%)`; 
let stroke = `hsl(${Gen.random(0, 120)} 80% 80% / ${Gen.random(5, 40)}%)`;
let strokeWidth = `${Gen.random(1, 3)}`;
```

You'll notice here that I've constrained the x and y variables to a
range of 200 to 800, which ensures our shapes remain within that region
and don't cover the entire canvas. This is so that we end up something
that more closely resembles a composition than an explosion.

Next we'll set up a props variable (a commonly used shorthand for
properties). The idea is that we set our element properties in
accordance with the element chosen. Given that each element has its own
distinct syntax for certain attributes (e.g., a rect has an x and y, but
a circle has a cx and cy), we need to have a way of conditionally
populating the props. There are a few ways we could approach this, but a
switch statement lends itself particularly well to this situation. It
allows us to populate the props variable on a case-by-case basis (quite
literally, as you'll see).

```
// Initialise the properties variable. let props;
// Populate the properties depending on the element chosen.
switch(element) { case \'circle\': props = { cx: x, cy: y, r:
Gen.random(1, 10), fill: fill, stroke: stroke, stroke_width: strokeWidth
}; break; case \'line\': props = { x1: x, y1: y, x2: x +
(Gen.random(-20, 20)), y2: y + (Gen.random(-20, 20)), stroke: stroke
}; break; case \'rect\': props = { x: x, y: y, width: Gen.random(5, 25),
height:
Gen.random(5, 25), fill: fill, stroke: stroke, stroke_width:
strokeWidth, transform: \`rotate(\${Gen.random(0, 360)} 500 500)\`
};
}
```

The one line here that perhaps calls for a little further explanation is
the transform attribute included in the rect properties. This attribute
can take either a translate, rotate, scale, or skew command as its
argument, along with a transform value and two other values that
represent the transform origin. The origin is a set of x and y
coordinates that define the point relative to which the transform
occurs. For example, in the case of the rotate command, we are randomly
rotating the rect relative to 500 500, that is, the center of the
viewBox.

We have one line left to include in the loop, right after our switch
statement. This is the line that actually creates the element and
applies the props to it.

```
// Create the element and set its properties.
svg.create(element).set(props);
```

When you run the sketch now, you should (hopefully) see something along
the lines of Figure 4-3. Perhaps we weren't so successful in making it
look less explosive (it looks like an eruption of confetti to me), but
the different shapes and the addition of stroke values definitely add
more in the way of variety and visual interest.

***Figure 4-3.** A confetti-like scattering of random elements*

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
**Regular Grids**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Unrestrained randomness will only get us so far; we need techniques to
tame and constrain it. One particularly prominent technique in the
generative art world is to work with grids, which allow us to structure
our randomness.

<h2>The Nested For Loop</h2>

The nested for loop consists of one loop running within another. Because
grids are comprised of columns (along the x axis) and rows (along the y
axis), the nested for loop comes in very useful in their construction.
What we'll typically do is start along the y axis and create our rows,
and for each row, we move from left to right along the x axis, filling
out each cell within the column. This movement mimics how computers have
historically drawn pixel data to their displays; start at the top left,
move across, and work your way down.

The outer loop will therefore be our y axis, moving down. For each
iteration of the y axis, the inner (nested) loop will move across,
populating the x axis.

```
// Example nested loop structure.
for (let y = 0; y \< height; y += 1) { for (let x = 0; x \< width; x
+= 1) {

// Code goes here.
}
}
```

Let's create a sketch to better illustrate this. Copy and rename the
template folder, renaming it to 07-regular-grids. Below the background,
we'll set up a group element to act as our grid container.

```
// Create our grid container group.
let grid = svg.create(\'g\');
```

Now we'll run our for loop, appending a rect element to the grid on each
iteration.

```
// A nested loop to visualise the grid. 
for (let y = 0; y < 700; 
  y += 50) { 
    for (let x = 0; x < 700; x += 50) { 
	  grid.create('rect').set({
        x: x, 
		y: y, 
		width: 40, 
		height: 40, 
		fill: 'none', 
		stroke: '#eee'
      });
    }
  }
```

The values we've used here aren't especially meaningful; we could have
chosen a different increment value, iteration count, width and height
for the square, etc. We can tidy up these values later. What you will
notice if you run live-server is that the grid is positioned off-center,
to the top left (as our x and y values initialize at 0). We could adjust
the x and y values until the grid lines up with the center of the
viewBox, but that would involve some tedious trial and error and would
need to be adjusted each time we altered the grid. Instead, let's use
the built-in SvJs moveTo() method.

The moveTo() method moves a given element by its center point to a new
position. The new position is passed in as an (x, y) coordinate pair.
This method is especially useful on a group element (where the center
point isn't straightforward to calculate) but can also be used as a more
intuitive alternative to the transform: translate(x y) syntax.

SvJs also offers a related getCentre() method (which the moveTo() method
also utilizes internally) to retrieve an element's center coordinates,
returned as an object with x and y properties. This is useful when you
want to position one element inside another.

After the loop, call the moveTo() method as follows:

```
// Centre the grid within the viewBox. 
grid.moveTo(500, 500);
```

The grid should now line up nicely in the center of our viewBox, as
shown in Figure 4-4.

![](./images/image024.jpg){width="3.15in" height="3.15in"}

***Figure 4-4.** A regular, centered grid*

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>A More Flexible Grid</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
So far we have hard-coded our grid values. By this, I mean we have used
values directly to control the grid divisions, cell spacing, size, etc.,
rather than variables containing values. The latter approach allows for
more flexibility.

Before our for loop, set and initialize the following variables. The
values we'll use will reflect the grid we've already created; we'll
alter these afterward.

```
// Set some grid-related variables. 
let gridSize = 700; 
let rows = 15; 
let spacing = 5;
```

What we need next are variables that control the loop increment value
and the size of each cell. These values, however, should be *derived*
from those we've set previously, rather than worked out afresh each time
we want to change the grid. With a little bit of basic math, here's how
we'd do this:

```
let increment = gridSize / rows; 
let cellSize = Math.abs(increment - spacing);
```

The Math.abs() function just ensures our cellSize is always a positive
value, which can prevent errors if we go crazy with our rows and spacing
values. Next, we need to incorporate these values into our loop. Adjust
it as follows:

```
for (let y = 0; y < gridSize; y += increment) { for (let x = 0; x <
gridSize; x += increment) { grid.create('rect').set({ x: x, y: y,
width: cellSize, height: cellSize, fill: 'none', stroke: '#eee',
});
}
}
```

Now we can freely adjust our grid variables, and the loop will respond
accordingly. We could even randomize them and get a different grid on
each refresh (as per Figure 4-5).

let gridSize = Gen.random(400, 800); let rows = Gen.random(2, 20); let
spacing = Gen.random(5, 10);

![](./images/image025.jpg){width="4.725in"
height="1.5316666666666667in"}

***Figure 4-5.** Variations of our regular grid*

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
**Clip Paths and Color Palettes**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Now that we have our regular grid in place, we need to breathe some life
into it. The changes we're going to make are significant enough to
warrant a new iteration of our sketch, so if you'd prefer to keep what
we've done so far as a template, save and copy the existing sketch
folder and rename it to something like 08-colourful-grids, which will
give you a clue where we're taking this.

<h2>Arrays of Colors</h2>

In our previous "Elements Everywhere" sketch, we used Gen.random() to
generate our colors on the fly. But what if we wanted a particular color
palette, or a collection of color palettes, so that we could randomly
choose between them?

One popular approach is to store a pre-chosen palette as an array of
color values, like so:

```
// Create a colour palette. 
let palette = ['#5465FF', '#788BFF',
'#9BB1FF', '#BFD7FF',
'#E2FDFF'];
```

There are many sites out there, too numerous to name, where you might
stumble upon color palette inspiration. In fact, you might find it
difficult to settle on a single palette, in which case it would make
sense to save a selection of them and store them as arrays *within*
another array. They would then become nested arrays, which are just
arrays contained within other arrays. You might also see them referred
to as 2D or multidimensional arrays.

Let's create a two-dimensional array containing three color palettes
(illustrated in Figure 4-6). Beneath where we defined our initial grid
group, include the following code (substituting in your own color
palettes if you prefer):

```
// Create our colour palettes. let palettes = [
['#5465FF', '#788BFF', '#9BB1FF', '#BFD7FF', '#E2FDFF'],
['#22577A', '#38A3A5', '#57CC99', '#80ED99', '#C7f9CC'],
['#4C5760', '#93A8AC', '#D7CEB2', '#A59E8C', '#66635B']
];
```

![](./images/image026.jpg){width="3.9366666666666665in"
height="2.0616666666666665in"}

***Figure 4-6.** Our three colour palettes*

Next, we're going to randomly select one of these palettes and store it
in a variable that we can call on later.

// Pick a random palette. let pickedPalette = Gen.random(palettes);

Now on to our grid variables. You can leave this as they were from the
last sketch, but I'm not going to randomize the gridSize or spacing this
time, as I want to place the emphasis on other randomized elements of
the sketch.

let gridSize = 600; let rows = Gen.random(3, 10); let spacing = 10; let
increment = gridSize / rows; let cellSize = Math.abs(increment -
spacing);

<h2>Clipping Our Content</h2>

The next step in developing our grid-based composition will involve
something called a clipPath. Essentially what a clipPath does is define
the visible region of the shape it's applied to, in much the same way a
scissors might define a cardboard cutout.

Instead of using a square to define our grid cells, we'll use a square-
shaped clipPath. This way we can contain the content of our cells
without them spilling out into adjacent cells. Let's step out our sketch
for a moment to illustrate this. In Figure 4-7, we have a square-shaped
rect that defines the clipPath, while the circle is the clipped element.
On the right, you can see the effect of applying the clipPath to the
circle.

![](./images/image027.jpg){width="3.9366666666666665in"
height="1.9683333333333333in"}

***Figure 4-7.** How a clipPath works*

A clipPath requires an id so that it can be referenced later. Nested
within the clipPath element is the actual shape or path that will do the
"clipping." Here's how we'd create something like the semi-circle
example from Figure 4-7.

```
// Initialise the clipPath with an id.
let clip = svg.create('clipPath').set({ id: 'clip1' });

// Create the shape of the clipPath.
clip.create('rect').set({ x: 0, 
  y: 0, 
  width: 100, 
  height: 100, 
  stroke: '#fff' 
});

// Apply it to a circle via a call to its id.
svg.create('circle').set({ 
  cx: 100, 
  cy: 50, 
  r: 50, 
  fill: '#80ffe6',
  clip_path: 'url(#clip1)'
});
```

As you can see, the clipPath is called via its id, treated as an
internal url reference, much like gradients and patterns. Let's get back
to our sketch now and apply this same logic within our loop. First,
create the nested loop as we did before:

for (let y = 0; y \< gridSize; y += increment) { for (let x = 0; x \<
gridSize; x += increment) {

}

}

Next, create the clipPath. We need to create a unique id for each
instance, so we can't pass in a static string as we did previously --
otherwise, the id would be duplicated on each loop iteration. Instead
what we can do is use the x and y iterator variables to generate a
dynamic string, using template literal syntax like so:

// Create our clip path with a unique id. let clip =
svg.create(\'clipPath\').set({ id: \`\${x}\${y}\` });

Now we can create the actual shape of the clipPath. We'll keep it
straightforward and make it square, that is, a rect with a width and
height equal to our cellSize.

// Create the clip path shape.

clip.create(\'rect\').set({ x: x, y: y, width: cellSize, height:
cellSize });

With the clipPath in place, we need to decide what to put into it.
Here's where we can get creative! There are four corners of each cell,
so what we'll do is randomly center a group of circles at any one of
these four positions. The coordinates of these positions are determined
by the current x and y values, along with the cellSize. Here's how we'd
calculate these positions and choose one of them at random:

// Define our possible positions. let positions = \[

\[x, y\], // top left

\[x + cellSize, y\], // top right

\[x + cellSize, y + cellSize\], // bottom right

\[x, y + cellSize\] // bottom left

\];

// Pick a random position. let pickedPosition = Gen.random(positions);

Now, to create the circle group. This will involve a third loop (so a
loop within a loop within a loop -- loopception if you will), where we
will create five circles radiating out from a randomly chosen center
point. And let's not forget about our palette picked out earlier; the
fill of each circle will be colored accordingly.

// Create a group for our circles. let circles = grid.create(\'g\');

// Create the circles, applying the picked position and palette.

for (let i = 0; i \< 5; i += 1) { circles.create(\'circle\').set({ cx:
pickedPosition\[0\], cy: pickedPosition\[1\],

r: cellSize - (i \* (cellSize / 5)), // this took a bit of tweaking

fill: pickedPalette\[i\]

});

}

We have a couple more steps to go. We haven't actually *applied* the
clipPath to anything yet, so if we were to run our sketch at this point,
we'd just see a fairly cluttered overlap of circles. We'll fix this by
applying the clipPath to the circle group rather than the circles
themselves. And as the last step within the loop, we'll create a square
border to frame each cell, just to give things a little more definition.

```
// Apply the clip path to the circle group. 
circles.set({ clip_path: `url(#${clip.get('id')})` });

// Create a square to frame the cell.
grid.create('rect').set({ 
  x: x, 
  y: y, 
  width: cellSize, 
  height: cellSize, 
  fill: 'none', 
  stroke: '#eee', 
});
```

Now, outside the loop, center our grid as we've done before.

```
// Centre the grid within the viewBox. 
grid.moveTo(500, 500);
```

And voila! You should now see some variations similar to those of Figure
4-8. (As an aside, if you find that the grid isn't always centering
properly, that's because the grid's bounding box includes the invisible
clipped content, which won't always arrange itself symmetrically around
the grid.)

***Figure 4-8.** Colorful clip path grid patterns*
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
**Choice and Chance**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
What if we were to bring an element of chance into choosing whether or
not to populate a given cell in our grid? This can lead to a less
rigid-looking composition -- which isn't necessarily better, but it can
offer more in the way of variety.

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>The SvJs Gen.chance( ) Function</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

When we talk about probability, what we're usually trying to establish
are the chances, or the odds, of something occurring. This something
will either happen or it won't, so what we want is a binary response --
or boolean -- to tell us yes or no, win or lose. Will your horse Victor
Vector give you a payout at the races today? Given the odds are 7 to 2,
there's a 22% chance of some winnings (2 / (7 + 2) x 100 = 22.22).

How could we work this kind of logic into our compositions? It's
actually quite simple to do with plain JavaScript and Math.random(), but
SvJs offers a more intuitive, less verbose alternative with its
Gen.chance()

function.

By default (i.e., without any arguments), Gen.chance() returns either
true or false based on odds of 50/50, or 50%. If we supply a single
argument, it's interpreted as a percentage.

```
// The below returns true 60% of the time.
Gen.chance(60);
```

If two numbers are supplied, the arguments are interpreted as odds. This
can be useful if you prefer thinking of probabilities more in terms of
placing a bet at a bookie than calculating a precise percentage value
(which is actually done for you under the hood).

```
// There is a 7 to 2 chance of this returning true.
Gen.chance(7, 2);
```

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Chance in Action</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Let's create a new sketch, using Gen.chance() to determine whether or
not the cells within our grid get populated with content. Copy the
08-colourful-grids folder and rename it to 09-chance, and then remove
all content from the inner loop (leaving you with an empty nested for
loop). Next, replace the palettes array and pickedPalette variable with
a randomly generated hue.

```
// Pick a random hue. let hue = Gen.random(0, 360);
```

You can leave the grid-related variables as they are, or tweak them if
you prefer. Next, *between* the x and y loops (so within the first loop
but before the second), increment the hue like so:

```
// A nested loop to create the grid. for (let y = 0; y \< gridSize; y +=
increment) {

// Increment the hue relative to the rows, keeping it within 0 and 360.
hue = (hue \>= 360) ? (hue - 360) + (120 / rows) : hue + (120 / rows);
for (let x = 0; x \< gridSize; x += increment) { \...
```

This might seem like an overly complex way of increasing the hue value,
but really it's just doing two things: first, it's ensuring the hue
value doesn't stray out of bounds (i.e., beyond 360), and second, it's
incrementing the hue value relative to the number of rows. This is so
that sketch variations with a lower row count have a higher increment
value, and those with a higher row count have a lower increment value,
resulting in greater color consistency overall.

Inside the x loop is where we'll actually use Gen.chance(). Used as a
condition inside an if statement, we can conditionally fire a third loop
based on the result it returns. This loop will create random line
elements inside each cell, but only if the cell is activated by the
Gen.chance() function. We'll set the actual probability to 60%.

```
// Run the loop based on chance.
if (Gen.chance(60)) { for (let i = 0; i < cellSize; i += 1) {
grid.create('line').set({ x1: Gen.random(x, x + cellSize), y1:
Gen.random(y, y + cellSize), x2: Gen.random(x, x + cellSize), y2:
Gen.random(y, y + cellSize), stroke: `hsl(${hue} 80% 80% / 0.33)`
});
}
}
```

This should result in gradiented tetris-like arrangements, similar to
Figure 4-9.

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
**Probability Distributions**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

Probability distributions describe how numbers are spread out (or
distributed) over a given range. Unless you've studied statistics in one
form or another, you may not be too familiar with the term. And if the
mere mention of statistics causes you to break out in a cold sweat,
don't worry -- we won't be delving into the underlying mathematics.
We've actually been using a particular kind of probability distribution
already but just haven't attached the name to it.

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Uniform Distribution</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
The Gen.random() function is an example of *uniform* distribution, where
every number within the range has an equal chance of being chosen. In
other words, there are no biases or tendencies hiding with the
Gen.random() function (or indeed, the Math.random() on which it is
based) that make it more likely that a certain subset of numbers within
the range will be selected.

In Figure 4-10, we can see uniform distribution visualized as the
variation of the x coordinate in the placement of 1000 vertical lines.
The lines are all scattered with equal chance of appearing anywhere
along the x axis.

> ![](./images/media/image30.jpg){width="4.725in" height="0.55in"}

***Figure 4-10.** Uniform distribution of vertical lines*

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Gaussian Distribution</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

In real-life measurements (i.e., those outside the binary world of ones
and zeros), uniform distribution isn't actually that common. Far more
prevalent is something called *Gaussian* distribution, where the
majority of values cluster toward a midpoint and drop off either side of
this. It is also known as normal distribution, and when graphed, it
forms a bell-shaped curve. Visualized as a series of vertical lines, it
looks like Figure 4-11.

![](./images/image031.jpg){width="4.725in"
height="0.5066666666666667in"}

***Figure 4-11.** Gaussian distribution of vertical lines*

The midpoint around which most values accumulate is known as the mean,
and the degree to which they drop off, or deviate, from this mean is
known as sigma, or the standard deviation.

SvJs comes with a function called Gen.gaussian() that returns a random
number that adheres to a Gaussian distribution. With no arguments, it
will return values between approximately -3 and +3, with a mean of 0 and
a standard deviation of 1. What this means in practice is that

-   68% of values will be within -1 and 1 (the standard deviation)

-   95% of values will be within -2 and 2

-   99% of values will be within -3 and 3

By supplying arguments to Gen.gaussian(), we can modify the mean and
standard deviation.

```
// Adjusting the mean and standard deviation to 10 and 2 respectively.
Gen.gaussian(10, 2);
```

In the preceding example, adjusting the mean to 10 and standard
deviation to 2 would translate to 68% of values falling within -2 and +2
of the mean (so between 8 and 12), 95% falling between 6 and 14, and
more than 99% falling between 4 and 16. Strictly speaking, the values of
a Gaussian distribution aren't bounded, so there may be occasional
extreme outliers. If, for example, you wanted to make sure you kept the
results to within a factor of 3 either side of the standard deviation,
you could use the Gen.constrain() function to bound the results like so:

```
// Bounding the results of Gen.gaussian() to within -3 and +3. 
let gaussian = Gen.gaussian(0, 1);
let constrainedGaussian = Gen.constrain(gaussian, -3, 3);
```

Let's move on and create a quick sketch to illustrate how we could use
the results returned from Gen.gaussian() to map x and y coordinates
across our viewBox. Copy our template and call it something like
10-gaussian-dist. In the usual place below our background, initialize a
loop that will run 10,000 times (yep, that's a lot!), and inside it,
generate a couple of Gaussian coordinates.

```
// Run a loop 10,000 times. 
for (let i = 0; i < 10000; i += 1) {
  // Generate x and y co-ordinates with a gaussian distribution.
  let gaussianX = Gen.gaussian(500, 150); 
  let gaussianY = Gen.gaussian(500, 150); 
}
```

The coordinates are based around the center of the viewBox (i.e., 500),
with a standard deviation of 150. Next, and still within the loop,
create our lines, basing them on our Gaussian coordinates and adding a
bit of randomization to their endpoints.

```
// Create the lines based on the gaussian co-ordinates.
svg.create('line').set({ x1: gaussianX, y1: gaussianY, x2: gaussianX +
Gen.random(-10, 10), y2: gaussianY + Gen.random(-10, 10), stroke:
`hsl(${Gen.random(150, 270)} 80% 80% / 0.8)` });
```

You could stop here and see the circular pattern that emerges, but I
added another little loop (after the first one, not within it) to subtly
emphasize the shape of the distribution with a series of fading circular
strokes.

```
// Create a series of circles to frame the distribution. for (let i = 0;
i \< 10; i += 1) { svg.create(\'circle\').set({ cx: 500, cy: 500, r:
25 + (i \* 25), fill: \'none\', stroke: \`hsl(0 0% 0% / \${0.25 - (i /
50)})\`, stroke\_ width: 15
});
}
```

After this, you should end up with something similar to Figure 4-12.

***Figure 4-12.** Using Gen.gaussian to position 10,000 lines*

In terms of the generated markup, it's quite a heavy piece compared to
anything we've done previously (10,000 elements will do that). This can
adversely impact render performance and also means a bigger SVG file if
you copy it from the HTML. One easy way to get the size down somewhat is
to set the third argument to false in each instance of the
Gen.gaussian() function. Like Gen.random(), Gen.gaussian() accepts a
third argument that determines whether it returns a float (more accurate
but with a lot of digits) or an integer (whole number). Dealing in whole
numbers decreases the generated markup by roughly a factor of two in
this case.

<h2>Pareto Distribution</h2>

Pareto distribution, also known as the Pareto Principle or the 80-20
rule

(illustrated in Figure 4-13), is the final probability pattern we'll
cover. It is named after an Italian economist who famously observed that
just 20% of a society's population controlled 80% of its wealth. This
was the 1890's mind, so had Pareto made the same observations today, we
might be discussing the 99-1 rule! Be that as it may, the basic idea
remains the same: there is a lot with a little and a little with a lot.

***Figure 4-13.** Pareto distribution of vertical lines*

This can be useful in generative art to achieve a balance of differently
sized elements. We'll use this in our next sketch to create a pseudo-
cityscape called Porto Pareto, where the size of the city's buildings
will be varied using the SvJs Gen.pareto() function. This function takes
two arguments; the first defines the minimum number in the range to be
returned, and the second defines whether this number will be a float or
integer.

```
// Return a pareto-distributed integer, not less than 20.
Gen.pareto(20, false);
-> 32
```

Copy the template folder and name it 11-porto-pareto, and below the
background, create a group that will contain our cityscape.

```
// Create a group for our generative city.
let portoPareto = svg.create(\'g\');
```

The cityscape will have three main elements: the sky, the river (or
port), and the buildings. The sky and river will both be simple rect
elements with gradients; we'll create these first.

```
// Create the sky gradient. 
svg.createGradient('sky', 'linear',
['#f58b10', '#d21263',
'#940c5e', '#25226c'],
90);

// Create the sky and apply the gradient.
portoPareto.create('rect').set({ x: 150, y: 150, width: 700, height:
400, fill: 'url(#sky)' });

// Create the river gradient. 
svg.createGradient('river', 'linear',
['#80e5ff10', '#70b566'], 90);

// Create the river and apply the gradient.
portoPareto.create('rect').set({ x: 150, y: 555, width: 700, height:
295, fill: 'url(#river)' });
```

Hopefully there won't have been any surprises in the aforementioned.

Next up, we'll deal out some Pareto distribution and create our
buildings. In the following loop, there's one line in particular I want
to unpack, and this is where we set the height using the Gen.constrain()
function. Without it, our Pareto distribution would generate some
dizzyingly high buildings that would extend well beyond the canvas
limits. However, using Gen.constrain() alone with a set upper limit
leads to a clipped effect on the highest buildings, so to even this out,
I've added in a Gen.random() function to vary the upper limit.

```
// A loop for our generative cityscape.
for (let i = 0; i < 60; i += 1) {
  // Get a pareto distribution with a min height of 20. 
  let pareto = Gen.pareto(20);

  // Constrain the height, and slightly randomise the upper limit. 
  let height = Gen.constrain(pareto, 20, Gen.random(150, 200));

  // Create our buildings.
  portoPareto.create('line').set({ 
    x1: 150 + (i * 12), 
	y1: 550, 
	x2: 150 + (i * 12), 
	y2: 550 - height, 
	stroke: '#181818', 
	stroke_width: 8
  });
}
```

We now have our cityscape in place, but we're not done yet. It's quite
flat-looking, and I'd like it to be framed within a circle and for the
colors to look like they're emanating outward. To achieve this, I'm
going to use something called a mask.

<h2>Masking Our Content</h2>

A mask is very similar to a clipPath, except that it allows for degrees
of transparency. A clipPath is an all-or-nothing affair; you're either
inside or outside the bounds of the shape that defines it. With a mask,
you can fade content in or out depending on the brightness or luminance
of the shape. For this reason, it's most straightforward to use black
and white when creating masks. White (#ffffff) translates to a fully
transparent region, whereas black (#000000) translates to a fully opaque
region.

In Figure 4-14, the triangle is the mask shape, and the result of
applying it to the rect is shown on the right.

![](./images/media/image34.jpg){width="4.725in"
height="1.7666666666666666in"}

***Figure 4-14.** How masks work*

As with a clipPath, the mask element requires an id and is applied to
another element via a url reference to this id. What we're going to do
is create a mask with a circle shape, and the fill of this circle will
contain a radial gradient. We'll then apply it to the portoPareto group
we created earlier.

```
// Create a radial gradient. 
svg.createGradient('radialGrad', 'radial', ['#ffffff', '#ffffff60']);

// Create a mask, and inside it create the circle with the radial gradient.
let mask = svg.create('mask').set({ id: 'mask' });
mask.create('circle').set({ cx: 500, cy: 500, r: 325, fill: 'url(#radialGrad)', });

// Apply the mask to the group. 
portoPareto.set({ 
  mask: 'url(#mask)'
});
```

You should now see the cityscape cut out in the shape of this circle,
with the edges slightly fading out. As a final step, I've added in a
gradiented circular stroke to frame the content a little more clearly.

```
// Create a linear gradient for our circular frame.
svg.createGradient('strokeGrad', 'linear', ['#eeeeee', '#eeeeee15']);

// Create the frame and apply the gradient. 
svg.create('circle').set({
  cx: 500, 
  cy: 500, 
  r: 345, 
  fill: 'none', 
  stroke: 'url(#strokeGrad)',
  stroke_width: 2.5 
});
```

A variation of the result is shown in Figure 4-15.

<h1 id="ch5">CHAPTER 5 The Need for Noise</h1>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

In this chapter, we'll be covering the limitations of the random
functions we've utilized thus far and how these limitations can be
addressed by using the SvJs Noise module. We'll be exploring what noise
is and the uses to which it can be put, and by the end, we'll have added
a significant technique to our generative arsenal.

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
**Random Limits**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

Sometimes randomness is just too, well ... random. Even when we shape
randomized values with probability distributions and constrain them
within structured patterns, the variance between consecutive values
invariably has that characteristic "staccato" feel. In other words, the
values will always be somewhat jumpy and jittery when looked at side by
side.

You won't see a smooth progression from one value to another.

Don't get me wrong -- this is often what we want, and it's what random
functions are designed to do. But it can be tricky to create anything
that has an organic quality to it with randomness alone. For this, we
need noise.

**Making Noise**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

In 1997, Ken Perlin won an Oscar. What made this award unprecedented was
that Perlin wasn't an actor, director, or soundtrack composer, but a
programmer. For the movie *TRON*, released in 1982, Perlin had been

tasked with the development of procedural textures that would make 3D
objects look more natural (i.e., organic), and the algorithm he devised,
named Perlin noise, has since become ubiquitous in the world of computer
graphics. You'll find implementations in image editors like GIMP and
Photoshop, in vector editors like Inkscape and Illustrator, in 3D
graphics packages like Blender, and in countless video games down
through the ages. Minecraft is a great example; those infinite blocky
terrains where players mine for resources use height maps generated by
Perlin noise to determine their various peaks and troughs.

So Perlin noise is everywhere in the graphical domain. But what exactly
is it?

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Noise Explained</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

Technically, noise functions do produce random numbers, but they do so
in a smoothly ordered fashion, and this is what makes the difference. In
Figure 5-1, the height of the white lines is randomized using a Perlin
noise variable. This is an example of one-dimensional noise, that is,
noise values that operate along a single axis.

![](./images/media/image36.jpg){width="4.725in" height="1.04in"}

***Figure 5-1.** A one-dimensional representation of Perlin noise
values*

Noise is by nature multidimensional; Perlin originally designed it for
3D spaces, and there are four-dimensional implementations out there too,
but with SVG being a two-dimensional medium, I'll be sticking to the x
and y axes. The particular algorithm Perlin developed works by blending
randomized values in a gradiented fashion over a given area. This area,
or space, is more notional than actual; the noise values don't exist on
an actual plane or separate canvas, but rather in an abstract (and
infinite) space that we can retrieve values from.

For example, fetching a noise value at the conceptual coordinates of
(15, 20) would give us some value between -1 and 1. And when we slowly
traverse through this noise space to reach an adjoining coordinate, say
(16, 21), we get a series of smoothly varied values we can work with.
And it's what we can do with those values that make noise interesting
from an aesthetic perspective.

In Figure 5-2, we can see noise represented in two dimensions using the
full area of a canvas. This example is actually pixel based rather than
vector based, chosen because it's perhaps the best way to visually grasp
the notion of a noise space. Here, the alpha component of each pixel is
varied according to the corresponding noise value, creating a cloud-like
formation. You can immediately see why it would be useful for creating
textures.

values*

<h2>The SvJs Noise Module</h2>

The SvJs library comes with its own implementation of noise, designed to
be simple to use and to have as light a footprint as possible. It
resides in its own module, so like the Gen module, we have to import it
before we can use it.

```
import { Noise } from \'../../node_modules/svjs/src/index.js\';
```

Unlike Gen, which is a collection of functions, the Noise module is
class based, so we first need to instantiate it.

```
// Create an instance of the Noise class.
let noise = new Noise();
```

The class has a single method called get() that accepts an x coordinate
and optional y coordinate as arguments and returns the value at that
point in the noise space.

let noiseValue = noise.get(noiseX, noiseY);

That noiseValue won't be much use to us as a static value; what we need
to do is gradually modify it by traversing the noise space. We do this
by incrementing the noiseX and/or noiseY coordinates. Here's how this
might look within a loop:

```
// Initialise our noise instance and noise co-ordinates first. 
let noise = new Noise(); 
let noiseX = 15, noiseY = 20;

// Run the loop, slowly incrementing the co-ordinates to modify the value.
for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i += 1) {
  let noiseValue = noise.get(noiseX, noiseY); ... // Do something with noiseValue
  noiseX += 0.003; noiseY += 0.003; 
}
```

As you can see, we define the initial noiseX and noiseY coordinates
outside the loop, use them to fetch a noiseValue within it, and then
before the loop runs again, increment the coordinates by a very small
amount. This amount we might refer to as the noise speed or rate of
change. It's important when working with noise that this rate of change
is minimal; comparatively large leaps (e.g., by whole numbers) won't
yield usable results.

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
**Into the Noise Matrix**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

Let's copy our template and set up a new sketch folder called 12-noise-
matrix, to show how noise can be used to alter color values within a
grid. At the top of our sketch.js file, add in the Noise module to our
import statement like so:

import { SvJs, Gen, Noise } from \'../../node_modules/svjs/src/
index.js\';

Next, we're going to shorten the expression that calculates the svgSize
(and thus the dimensions of our viewport). Instead of the ternary
operator, we can actually use the Math.min() function, which returns the
smallest of two or more values. If you remember, all we want to do is
set the svgSize to whichever of the window's innerWidth or innerHeight
is smallest, and Math.min() does this in the most succinct manner. A
small tweak to be sure, but one that hints at the many uses of
JavaScript's built-in Math module.

```
const svgSize = Math.min(window.innerWidth, window.
innerHeight);
```

I'd recommend applying this tweak to our base template too.

<h2>A Noisy Grid</h2>

For this composition, we'll be using a familiar technique: we'll be
setting up a grid, and this grid will act as our matrix (a matrix is,
after all, just a grid of values). And the matrix we'll be creating in
this sketch will mimic the one from the movie of the same name. We'll be
populating the grid with ones and zeros, and the color of these digits
will be modulated by noise to achieve that cascading, desaturated
effect.

Create an instance of the noise class, and then initialize three further
variables. Two will take care of our noise x and y coordinates, and in
the third, we'll store the noise speed that will determine the rate at
which we'll increment the noise coordinates.

```
// Create our noise, the noise x and y co-ordinates, and noise speed.
let noise = new Noise(); 
let nX = 0, nY = 0; 
let noiseSpeed = 0.5;
```

The next block of code should hopefully look familiar. We're setting
some grid-related variables, and this time we'll omit the spacing and
cellSize variables we used in previous sketches and set the gridSize to
cover the entire viewBox.
```
// Set some grid-related variables. 
let noiseGrid = svg.create('g');
let gridSize = 1000; let rows = 80;
let increment = gridSize / rows;
```

Next comes our loop. Instead of starting with the y coordinate in the
outer loop, we're going to start with the x coordinate. What this will
do is construct our grid from top to bottom and then left to right. In
other words, we'll fill out our columns first rather than the rows,
which will allow our noise values to flow in a downward motion.

Within the loop, we'll fetch our noise value using the noise.get()
method, passing in the nX and nY values we initialized earlier.

```
// Create the noise matrix.
for (let x = 0; x \< gridSize; x += increment) { for (let y = 0; y \<
gridSize; y += increment) { // Fetch the noise value. let noiseValue =
noise.get(nX, nY);
}
}
```

Next, let's create the actual text content. We want a series of ones and
zeros to fill the grid, with a 50% chance of either digit being chosen.
As we learned in the last chapter, the Gen.chance() function is the
simplest way to do this, combined with a ternary operator.

```
// Create text displaying either 0 or 1 (50% chance).
let text = noiseGrid.create(\'text\'); text.content(Gen.chance() ? \'1\'
: \'0\');
```

Now we need to set the position of the digit with respect to the x and y
loop iterator values and set the intensity of the fill color (i.e., the
lightness component of the hsl() function) with the noiseValue variable.
We should also set a font size and font family while we're at it.

```
text.set({ x: x, y: y, font_size: 16, font_family: \'serif\', fill:
\`hsl(120 20% \${noiseValue}%)\` });
```

And before we close out our loop, we'll want to increment our nX and nY
values with the noiseSpeed variable.
```
nX += noiseSpeed; nY += noiseSpeed; 
```
To finish off the sketch, outside
the loop, call the moveTo() function to shift the grid to the center of
the canvas.
```
// Centre the grid within the viewBox. noiseGrid.moveTo(500, 500);
```
You should now see a grid of zeros and ones when you run your sketch.
But ... they're all black. The color lightness isn't visibly changing,
even though we're using our noiseValue to modify it. What's going on
here?

If you inspect some of the text elements in the browser console, you'll
see something like the following:

```
\<text x=\"860\" y=\"960\" font-size=\"16\" font-family=\'serif\'
fill=\"hsl(120 20%

-0.11888951723051341%)\"\>0\</text\>

\<text x=\"860\" y=\"980\" font-size=\"16\" font-family=\'serif\'
fill=\"hsl(120 20%

-0.06168012594419729%)\"\>1\</text\>

\<text x=\"880\" y=\"0\" font-size=\"16\" font-family=\'serif\'
fill=\"hsl(120 20%

0.061791625695004807%)\"\>0\</text\> \<text x=\"880\" y=\"20\"
font-size=\"16\" font-family=\'serif\' fill=\"hsl(120 20%
0.1202821001266494%)\"\>1\</text\>
```

The point to note here is that when we call the noise.get() method, the
value returned is a float between -1 and 1 (with some occasional
outliers). The lightness component of the hsl() function, however,
should have values between 0 and 100%, so in its raw state, the noise
value isn't very useful here. How might we fix this? Couldn't we just
multiply it by a factor of 100? We could, but we'd then have an equal
amount of numbers in the negative range. And if we tried to remedy this
with Math.abs() to force the negative numbers into a positive range,
that would destroy the very raison d'Ãªtre of noise -- its smoothly
transitioning values. So what's the solution?

<h2>Mapping the Noise Values</h2>

This is actually a common challenge in generative art -- mapping a
series of values from one range to another. Thankfully the Gen module
comes equipped with a function that does just this: Gen.map().

The function requires five arguments, with an optional sixth: the first
is the value to be mapped to the new range, the second and third
arguments define the lower and upper bounds of the existing range, and
the fourth and fifth arguments define the lower and upper bounds of the
range to which we want our value mapped. The final sixth argument
specifies whether a float should be returned. In common with other Gen
functions like gaussian and pareto, this is set to true by default, and
setting it to false rounds the result to the nearest integer. The
following is an example:

```
// Map a number (5) from one range (0, 10) to another (0, 100). let num
= 5; num = Gen.map(num, 0, 10, 0, 100); console.log(num); -\> 50
```

If we apply the Gen.map() function to our noiseValue variable, we can
retrieve a more usable value. We could assign this new mapped value to a
new variable, or as the preceding example shows us, we can simply
reassign the original variable.

```
// Fetch the noise value. let noiseValue = noise.get(nX, nY);
// Map the noise value to a useful range. noiseValue =
Gen.map(noiseValue, -1, 1, 0, 100, false);
```

Once you've done this, you should see some color injected into our
matrix (as per Figure 5-3). Enough we hope to get an appreciative nod
from Neo.

![](./images/media/image38.jpg){width="3.15in" height="3.15in"}

***Figure 5-3.** That chunk of the matrix that tastes like chicken*

It's worth noting that when using a generic font-family like serif, you
essentially let the operating system decide which default font to
render. For this reason, what you see may differ slightly from Figure
5-3.

<h2>Optimize with Style</h2>

We could leave it there and make no further changes to the sketch, but
there's one little niggle I can't leave alone. In total, we have 2,500
text elements in this sketch, and for each of these elements, the
font-size and font-family attributes remain static throughout. This
seems quite wasteful.

```
\<text x=\"740\" y=\"200\" font-size=\"16\" font-family=\"serif\"
fill=\"hsl(120 20%
50%)\"\>1\</text\>
```

What we can do is first remove the font attributes set within the loop
so that the text.set() method looks like the following:

text.set({ x: x, y: y, fill: \`hsl(120 20% \${noiseValue}%)\` });

Then we can create a style element and within it, target all our text
elements at once. Near the top of our sketch, after the parent SVG
declaration, include the following code:

```
// Set some text styling.
svg.create(\'style\').content(\` text { font-size: 16px; font-family:
serif;
}
\`);
```

Note the use of backticks here; this allows us to indent our code just
as we would with normal CSS. What this CSS does is apply the font-size
and font-family to each of our text elements, avoiding the use of
repetitive inline attributes. This is not only a more elegant way of
handling static styles, but it can save us quite a few kilobytes along
the way. In this particular sketch, taking this measure resulted in a
40% reduction in the rendered markup -- not bad!

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
**Spinning Noise**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

In our next sketch, to consolidate some of the concepts covered already,
we're going to spin some line elements about their center points and
vary their line lengths and colors with noise. This time we'll use just
a single loop and noise dimension.

Copy the previous sketch folder and name it something like
13-spinning-noise. Remove the style element and everything after the
background so that we're left with the following boilerplate code:

```
import { SvJs, Gen, Noise } from \'../../node_modules/svjs/src/
index.js\';

// Parent SVG. const svg = new SvJs().addTo(document.
getElementById(\'container\'));
// Viewport and viewBox (1:1 aspect ratio).
const svgSize = Math.min(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
svg.set({ width: svgSize, height: svgSize, viewBox: \'0 0 1000 1000\'
});
// Background.
svg.create(\'rect\').set({ x: 0, y: 0, width: 1000, height: 1000, fill:
\'#181818\' });
```

We'll then set up our noise-related variables, along with a couple of
randomized values that will determine our initial hue and the amount of
times our loop will run.

// Noise-related and randomised variables. let noise = new Noise(); let
nX = 0; let noiseSpeed = 0.025; let lines = svg.create(\'g\'); let hue =
Gen.random(0, 360); let iterations = Gen.random(60, 100);

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Mapping and Constraining</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
We can now run the loop. We'll offset our iteration start point by 10 ;
for this particular sketch, this value just worked better than starting
at the usual 0. Within the loop, we'll fetch the noiseValue, and then
we'll extract two further variables from this by individually mapping
the value to different ranges. One will control how much we shift the
hue, and the other will control the length of each line.

```
// Start the dance. for (let i = 10; i \< iterations; i += 1) { let
noiseValue = noise.get(nX); let hueShift = Gen.map(noiseValue, -1, 1,
-180, 180, false); let lineLength = Gen.map(noiseValue, -1, 1, 0, 1000,
false); }
```

After the lineLength variable (and still within the loop), set up the
first of our lines. We will start off with a straight vertical line at
(0, 0) (the top left of our viewBox), and we'll worry about centering
things later. As it's a vertical line, the second x coordinate won't
change -- only the second y coordinate will.

Next comes the stroke value. We'll wrap this in the Gen.constrain()
function to keep the values between 0 and 360, and inside this, the hue
will increment by the hueShift. We'll then set both the opacity (within
the hsl() function) and the stroke-width to 0.5, which will keep the
line nice and delicate.

```
let l1 = lines.create(\'line\').set({ x1: 0, y1: 0, x2: 0, y2:
lineLength,
stroke: \`hsl(\${Gen.constrain(hue + hueShift, 0, 360)} 80% 80%
/ 0.5)\`, stroke_width: 0.5
});
```

For the second line, we'll do much the same, except this time we'll
stretch the lineLength a little, shift the hue in the opposite
direction, and also reduce its opacity.

```
let l2 = lines.create(\'line\').set({ x1: 0, y1: 0, x2: 0, y2:
lineLength \* 1.1,
stroke: \`hsl(\${Gen.constrain(hue - hueShift, 0, 360)} 80% 80%
/ 0.25)\`, stroke_width: 0.5 });
```

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Rotating and Translating</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

The final step will involve some transforms and the usual incrementation
of our noise coordinate. We'll rotate the first line positively in a
clockwise direction and the second line negatively in an anticlockwise
direction. For this, we'll use the SvJs rotate() method, which is
simpler than setting a transform: rotate() attribute as we've done in
some previous sketches. It also boasts some additional benefits:

-   It rotates relative to its own center by default, rather than the
    top left of the canvas.

-   It preserves any existing transforms, rather than overwriting them
    as the transform attribute does.

With that in mind, let's continue with the sketch and complete the loop.

l1.rotate(i); l2.rotate(-i); nX += noiseSpeed; And finally, outside the
loop, move the lines to the center of the canvas and rotate them by a
random amount between 0 and 360.

```
lines.moveTo(500, 500); lines.rotate(Gen.random(0, 360));
```

As you can see in Figure 5-4, what we end up are a series of slightly
asymmetric lines that somewhat resemble, to me at least, the dance of
some deep-sea creatures.

**Summary**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
While there's certainly more to explore where noise is concerned, we've
covered the basics here, and we will be utilizing noise again in the
forthcoming chapters. If you want to be able to tinker more with the
nuts and bolts of noise, I'd encourage you to check out some third-party
libraries like the popular SimplexJS, which goes beyond two dimensions
and allows for greater freedom of configuration (at a cost of size,
however).

Before we move on, let's quickly recap what we've covered in this
chapter:

-   The limits of randomness when creating more organic forms and how
    noise addresses this limitation

-   The theory behind the abstract noise space

-   How to put this into practice with the SvJs Noise module

-   How to traverse the noise space within a loop

-   How to use noise values to modify element coordinates and colors

-   Mapping and constraining noise values to more useful ranges

-   Optimizing repetitive element attributes with CSS

-   Nondestructive element rotations

In the next chapter, we're going to cover a fundamental part of the SVG
spec: the very powerful path element.
<!-- page 137 -->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 id="ch6">CHAPTER 6: The All-Powerful Path</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Paths are perhaps the most important and most powerful part of the SVG
spec. Most SVG files, be they simple icons or complex artworks, consist
primarily of path data. If, for example, you draw anything more advanced
than a primitive shape in a vector graphics program like Inkscape or
Illustrator, you are ipso facto working with paths. And no, to program
paths manually in JavaScript and SvJs, you don't need to be a
mathematical wizard.

This chapter will cover the path element and its associated commands,
which are sufficiently numerous to need their own subsections. Paths can
get complicated quickly, so we'll also be covering some SvJs methods to
make our lives easier.

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h3 id="ch6-1">6.1 The Path Element</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
It's simple to set up a path; we just call the SvJs create() method as
we would with most other elements: let path = svg.create(\'path\');

Paths accept the usual fill and stroke attributes that other graphical
elements do, but unlike other graphical elements (like rect and circle),
they come with no intrinsic form or shape. This is entirely up to us to
define, and we do so via the d attribute.

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>D for Data</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
The d attribute allows us to populate a path with data. This data
consists of a series of path commands and accompanying numeric values
that define the form the path takes. The data as a whole is passed in as
a string.

The creators of the SVG spec knew that paths would feature heavily in
most SVG files, so creating concise path commands was a crucial part of
keeping down the overall kilobyte count. They are therefore of single-
character length, like the d attribute to which they are passed, and the
values that accompany the commands can also be flexibly formatted to
conserve space.

// An example of a string of path data. path.set({ d: \'M 20,20 L 30,20
L 30,30 L 20,30 Z\' });

// An identical path using a more concise string. path.set({ d: \'M20
20L30 20L30 30L20 30Z\' });

We'll go into more detail in later sections as to how examples like the
aforementioned work; for now, just note that the very same path data can
be written with or without commas to separate values and with or without
spaces to separate commands.

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Path Commands</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

You can think of path commands as drawing instructions. Each command is
represented by a letter, and this letter can be either uppercase or
lowercase. The uppercase version indicates that the values which follow
will use absolute coordinates (so the command M 50,50 would mean moving
to the exact position of 50,50 in the viewBox), whereas the lowercase
version means that relative coordinates will be used (so the command m
50,50 would mean moving by +50 on both the x and y axes relative to the
last known position).

There are a total of ten commands; twenty if you count the two versions.
And if you think that sounds like a lot, you'd be right! It is a lot.
But there's an amazing economy to these commands when you consider that
they can be combined to create any possible two-dimensional shape. Some
commands are more common than others, some more complex, and some we'll
demonstrate the once and won't use again.

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
**Starting and Ending a Path**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

All paths start somewhere. And where SVG is concerned, all paths start
at the point to which we move our virtual pen. We use the M (or m)
command for this, which means "move to." We follow this with an x and y
coordinate pair to define the path's starting point. The M command by
itself doesn't draw anything -- it merely moves us to the point at which
we want to begin. Our pen has yet to push down on the paper, so to
speak.

```
// Syntax for the M/m command.
'M [x, y] ...'
'm [dx, dy] ...'

// Examples of the M/m command.
'M 50 100 ...'
'm 50 100 ...'
```

We can provide an optional Z command at the very end of a path to close
it. Paths without a closing Z command remain open (i.e., the starting
point and end point remain unconnected). Z will draw a straight line to
connect these two points unless the end point is a curve, in which case
it will follow the curvature of the last control point (this will make
more sense later on).

```
// Closing a path.
'M 50 100 ... 50 150 Z'
```

Unlike other path commands, the lowercase z and uppercase Z perform
identical operations, as no values follow them. This means you can use
them interchangeably.

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
**Straight Lines**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
To ease us into path creation, we'll start with the straight line. There
are actually a few different commands that can draw a straight line, but
we'll start with the most obvious.

<h2>The Simple L</h2>

The L command allows us to draw straight lines defined by an x and y
coordinate pair. The lowercase l does the same but uses coordinates
relative to the path's last entered point.

```
// Syntax for the L/l command.
'L [x, y] ...'
'l [dx, dy] ...'
```

Let's see what this looks like in practice. In the following example,
two lines are used to create two instances of the letter L. The first
uses absolute coordinates; the second uses relative coordinates.

```
// The first L.
svg.create('path').set({
d: 'M 300 200 L 300 800 L 600 800' });

// The second L.
svg.create('path').set({
d: 'M 675 825 l 0 -600 l -300 0' });
```

We can see a rendering of the preceding code in Figure 6-1. I've left
out any elements and attributes extraneous to the example and focused on
just the path data. As you can see, you can use either of the L commands
to achieve similar results.

When creating paths manually in this manner, some readers may find
absolute coordinates more intuitive to work with, while others may find
relative coordinates easier to use. Relative coordinates can be
especially useful if, say, you wanted to move a path's location without
disturbing its shape; with absolute coordinates, we'd have to change all
the subsequent numbers, whereas with relative coordinates, we'd only
have to change the initial M point.

> ![](./images/media/image40.jpg){width="3.15in" height="3.15in"}

***Figure 6-1.** Two L\'s drawn by two L commands*

<h2>Horizontal and Vertical Varieties</h2>

If the lines that we're drawing are either horizontal or vertical, we
can use the H or V commands as a shortcut, as they only need the one
parameter; in the case of H or h, the x coordinate, and in the case of V
or v, the y coordinate.

```
// Syntax for the H/h command.
'H [x] ...'
'h [dx] ...'

// Syntax for the V/v command.
'V [y] ...'
'v [dy] ...'
```

These commands I don't find particularly useful for generative art, but
it's worth knowing they're there should you want to use them. Let's
create the same L shapes from Figure 6-1, but with H and V this time,
including their lowercase versions.

```
// The first L.
svg.create('path').set({ d: 'M 300 200 V 800 H 600' });

// The second L.
svg.create('path').set({ d: 'M 675 825 v -600 h -300' });
```

<h2>Further Economies</h2>

Before we move on to curves, it's worth pointing out if we are using
successive path commands of the same type, the command itself can be
removed rather than repeated. SVG renderers are intelligent enough to
know that if a path command is omitted, the last-known command should be
used. Let's show a quick example (the output of which is shown in Figure
6-2).

// The first path, with repeating L commands. svg.create(\'path\').set({
d: \'M 10 10 L 20 20 L 30 10 L 40 20 L 50 10 L 60 20 L 70 10\' });

// The second (identical) path, with the repeating L commands omitted.

svg.create(\'path\').set({ d: \'M 10 10 L 20 20 30 10 40 20 50 10 60 20
70 10\'

});

***Figure 6-2.** Omitting repetitive commands*

**Quadratic Bezier Curves**

The first curve we'll cover is the quadratic Bezier curve. Don't worry
-- the rather daunting name doesn't reflect its complexity. As far as
curves go, it's relatively simple. Two sets of coordinates are required:
the first set defines the control point (which we'll explain in a
moment), and the second the destination point.

// Syntax for the Q/q command.

\'Q \[cpx cpy x y\] \...\'

\'q \[dcpx dcpy dx dy\] \...\'

<h2>Control Points</h2>

If you imagine a control point as a force of attraction, or pull, toward
which a curve bends, you'll have the right idea. Control points aren't
themselves rendered, but if you look at the dot and dashed line in
Figure 6-3, you can see a visualization of the force a control point
exerts over its curve (in this case, a quadratic Bezier curve). In this
example, the dot represents the control point coordinates of \[150,
350\], given the following path:

\'M 50 150 Q 150 350 250 150\'

> ![](./images/media/image42.jpg){width="3.15in" height="3.15in"}

***Figure 6-3.** The control point of a quadratic Bezier curve*

A quadratic Bezier curve has just the one control point, whereas the
cubic Bezier curve (explored in a later section), has two.

<h2>A Smooth Shortcut</h2>

Say we wanted to extend the path from Figure 6-3 and draw a smooth set
of waves repeating at regular intervals. The difficulty in doing this
manually is with the calculation of the control point; if it's not
perfectly symmetric with the previous one, a "kink" will appear in our
curve (see Figure 6-4). Now, in this particular case, it's not that
arduous a job to calculate a control point that would correct this, but
in more complex cases, this can become a challenge.

> ![](./images/media/image43.jpg){width="3.15in" height="1.89in"}

***Figure 6-4.** A kink in the curve*

This is where the T command can help us. It extends a quadratic Bezier
curve based on the previous curve's control point, essentially
"mirroring" or reflecting it. The result is a smooth curve with a
symmetric control point, and it requires just a single set of
coordinates.

// Syntax for the T/t command.

\'T \[x y\]\'

\'t \[dx dy\]\'

Let's extend the curve from Figure 6-4, adding a few extra undulations
to it. In the following example code, I'm adding some commas to the
coordinates for the sake of readability, but remember that they're not
actually required. I'm also taking advantage of the fact that I don't
need to repeat the T command when using it several times consecutively.
This is why you'll only see it used once for the four coordinates that
follow.

// Extending a quadratic curve with the smooth T command.
svg.create(\'path\').set({

d: \'M 50,150 Q 150,350 250,150 T 450,150 650,150 850,150 1050,150\'

});

Figure 6-5 is the result, with some circular highlights added in to
distinguish the initial M point (yellow) and the full Q curve (the
purple second point) from the four additional T points (in red).

***Figure 6-5.** A smooth quadratic curve*

<h2>A Quadratic Slinky</h2>

Let's use the quadratic Bezier curve in a simple sketch to create a
Slinky- esque array of paths. If you don't know what a Slinky is, it's a
popular spring-based toy that can "walk" itself down a set of steps if
given a nudge from the top (I'm sure it can perform many other
miraculous feats, but this is the one for which it's most widely known).

Copy the template folder and rename it to 14-quadratic-slinky. Below the
parent SVG, set some styles to target the path elements that we'll later
set up as children of a group to which we'll give an id of slinky.

// Style the slinky.

svg.create(\'style\').content(\`

#slinky path { fill: none; stroke-width: 0.75; stroke-linecap: round;

}\`

);

Next set up the usual background, initialize a random hue, and create
the aforementioned slinky group.

// Background.

svg.create(\'rect\').set({ x: 0, y: 0, width: 1000, height: 1000, fill:
\'#181818\' });

// Choose a random starting hue. let hue = Gen.random(0, 360);

// Set up the slinky path group. let slinky = svg.create(\'g\').set({
id: \'slinky\' });

In the next step, we'll fire up the loop and create a couple of control
points we'll use to shape our quadratic curve.

// Start the loop. for (let i = 0; i \< 500; i += 5) {

// Create the control points. let cpx = Gen.random(200, 400); let cpy =
i - 400; }

The width of our curve will be 600 units (relative to the viewBox), so
our halfway point will be 300. On the x axis, the cpx variable is
picking a random integer value 100 units either side of the halfway
point, to give our slinky some "wobble." The cpy variable is more
straightforward; it moves down the screen on each iteration, with an
offset of 400 units that will "pull" the curve upward.

> Next, let's create the actual curve (keeping within the loop).

// Create the quadratic curve. slinky.create(\'path\').set({ stroke:
\`hsl(\${hue} 90% 80% / 0.85)\`, d: \`M 0 \${i} q \${cpx} \${cpy} 600
0\` });

Here, we're setting the hue as we've done many times before, and for the
path, we're drawing one simple curve starting with the M command. For
the curve coordinates, we're taking advantage of the relative
coordinates calculated by the lowercase q command, which allows us to
keep the values in step with curve's starting point.

Before closing out the loop, we'll increment the hue, but we'll use a
new technique to do so. I mentioned the modulo operator (%) in Chapter 2
(in the section covering operators), which calculates a number's
remainder after division. This can be useful to cycle within predefined
ranges, such as the 0 to 360 constraints of a color's hue. Add the
following as the final line before the end of the loop:

// Increment the hue. hue = (hue % 360) + 1.5;

A quick explanation of how this works: say our random hue is initialized
to 350. The expression hue % 360 will return 350, because 350 / 360 is
0, with a remainder of 350. This works similarly for every number in our
range *except* 360, which returns 1 when divided by itself and returns a
remainder of 0. This is how it cycles back to the start of the range.

Now that our loop is done, we can add one more line outside it to ensure
the content is centered. The result should resemble Figure 6-6.

slinky.moveTo(500, 500);

> ![](./images/media/image45.jpg){width="3.15in" height="3.15in"}

***Figure 6-6.** Quadratic curves in a slinky formation*

**Elliptical Arcs**

Time to embark on the arc! The elliptical arc curve (Figure 6-7) is a
complicated beast, and the syntax is quite difficult to comprehend
without some visual examples. The A (or a) command is used to initialize
it, and it is followed by no less than seven arguments.

// Syntax for the A/a command.

\'A \[rx ry rotation large-arc-flag sweep-flag x y\] \...\'

\'a \[rx ry rotation large-arc-flag sweep-flag dx dy\] \...\'

The first two arguments and the last two arguments aren't anything we
haven't encountered before: rx and ry refer to the radii of the x and y
axes, and the final x and y arguments define the curve's destination
point.

The rotation defines the angle of rotation along the x axis, and the
largearc-flag and sweep-flag are both booleans in numeric form, 0
meaning false and 1 meaning true. What they do though takes a little
explaining.

> ![](./images/media/image46.jpg){width="3.15in" height="2.635in"}

***Figure 6-7.** An elliptical arc curve*

<h2>Setting the Flags</h2>

What's really happening when we draw an elliptical arc curve is that two
interlocking ellipses are used as guides behind the scenes to determine
which of the many possible paths are actually drawn. With the large-
arc- flag set to 1, a large arc will be chosen. And with the sweep-flag
set to 1, the arc will be drawn in a clockwise direction. Let's take a
look at Figure 6-8, in which four possible permutations of these flags
are shown.

-   In the uppermost path, the large-arc-flag and sweep-flag are both
    set to 1.

-   In the second path down, the large-arc-flag is set to 0 and the
    sweep-flag is set to 1.

-   In the third path down, the large-arc-flag and the sweep-flag are
    both set to 0.

-   In the lowermost path, the large-arc-flag is set to 1 and the
    sweep-flag is set to 0.

> ![](./images/media/image47.jpg){width="3.15in" height="2.52in"}

***Figure 6-8.** Four possible arcs*

In practice, you'll only ever see one of these arcs rendered on screen.
However, it helps us understand the underlying structure of the
elliptical arc when we see all the possible curves rendered
simultaneously.

<h2>Irregular Radii</h2>

One of the other potential confusions about the elliptical arc curve is
that the two radius values rx and ry work a little differently to how we
might expect. Normally, a radius would directly determine the size of an
elliptical shape. In the case of the elliptical arc curve, the size is
actually determined by a number of factors that work in conjunction, and
the rx and ry values are only one part of the equation.

You'll sometimes find, for instance, that the interlocking ellipses that
form the basis of the possible curves coincide; that is, they are
superimposed on one another. You'll know this is the case if setting the
large-arc-flag to either a 0 or a 1 makes no difference to the final
result. This can happen when the two radius values and the distance
between the curve start and end points are in a certain proportion to
each other.

It might therefore be easier to think of the rx and ry values as ratios
that influence the shape of the arc than as values that directly
determine the arc's magnitude (this is especially true when using
smaller radii values). Don't worry if this doesn't make much sense --
it's quite counterintuitive at first and only becomes clearer with
experimentation. And to aid in this experimentation and hopefully make
the elliptical arc curve a little more accessible, I've created an
interactive pen that shows the effect of altering both the radii and the
flag values. You can find the pen at
[davidmatthew.ie/generative-art-javascript-svg#arc-curve](https://davidmatthew.ie/generative-art-javascript-svg#arc-curve).

<h2>Generative Arcs</h2>

Let's take a break from further wrestling with the theoretical
intricacies of elliptical arc curves and put them to some practical,
creative use instead. Using our usual copy method, create a new sketch
folder and name it something like 15-generative-arcs. The aim of this
sketch will be to create two sets of arc curves: one set running
clockwise and the other set mirroring it, running anticlockwise. We'll
randomize a number of key variables to keep the output unique and
difficult to predict.

When you're ready, set up a group below the background that will contain
our arc curves. After that, we'll set up some randomized variables we'll
utilize in the loop that follows.

```
// Set up a container group for our arc curves.
let arcs = svg.create('g');
// Randomise some variables. 
let rx = Gen.random(5, 350); 
let ry = Gen.random(5, 350); 
let hue = Gen.random(0, 360);
```

Next we'll start our loop, which will run 360 times. Inside it, we'll
randomize some further variables: the arc's rotation, which will have
the effect of distending the curve in a particular direction, and the
large-arc- flag, which, thanks to our Gen.chance() function, will have a
50% chance of being either 0 or 1.

```
for (let i = 0; 
i < 360; i += 1) {
  // Randomise the rotation and large arc flag.
  let rotation = Gen.random(0, 180); 
  let largeArc = Gen.chance() ? 1 : 0;
}
```

Next (and still within our loop) create the first set of clockwise arc
curves. Remember, what makes them run either clockwise or anticlockwise
is the sweep-flag, which is the fifth argument of the A command. Here,
after our largeArc variable, we're setting the sweep-flag to 1, meaning
clockwise.

```
// Create a first set of clockwise arc curves (sweep = 1).
arcs.create('path').set({ fill: 'none', stroke: `hsl(${hue} 75% 75% / 0.05)`,
d: `M 275 500 A ${rx} ${ry} ${rotation} ${largeArc} 1 725 500`
});
```

The second set of arc curves will be identical, bar two small changes.
The sweep-flag we'll set to 0, making this set anticlockwise, and the
hue we'll offset by 60, just to add a bit of contrast to the colors. And
before we close out the loop, we'll increment the hue using the
aforementioned modulo operator.

```
// Create a second set of counter-clockwise arc curves (sweep = 0).
arcs.create('path').set({ fill: 'none', stroke: `hsl(${hue + 60}
75% 75% / 0.05)`,
d: `M 275 500 A ${rx} ${ry} ${rotation} ${largeArc} 0 725 500`
});
// Increment the hue. 
hue = (hue % 360) + 0.5;
```

If you run the sketch at this point, you'll see some nicely varied
generative arcs (example output in Figure 6-9). If you want to inject a
little more dynamism though, you could add the following line after the
loop:

```
// Apply a random rotation.
arcs.rotate(Gen.random(0, 360));
```

![](./images/media/image48.jpg){width="3.9366666666666665in" height="2.315in"}

***Figure 6-9.** Two renders of our generative arcs*

**Cubic Bezier Curves**

The final curve we'll cover is the cubic Bezier curve, called by the C
command. This is the most versatile of all the vector curves available
to us and is the main curve utilized in most vector drawing and
illustration packages (usually under the alias of the pen tool). It has
two sets of control points, so the syntax is a little more complex than
its quadratic counterpart, but it's easier to grapple with than the
elliptical arc curve.

```
// Syntax of the C/c command.
'C [cpx1 cpy1 cpx2 cpy2 x y] ...'
'c [dcpx1 dcpy1 dcpx2 dcpy2 dx dy] ...'
```

<h2>Cubic Control Points</h2>

The first set of control point coordinates cpx1 and cpy1 shapes the
curve from the side of the starting point. This starting point is
declared prior to the C command -- it might be a set of M coordinates,
for example, or the end point of a previous curve. The second set of
control point coordinates cpx2 and cpy2 shapes the curve of the
destination point, and this point is defined by the final two
coordinates: x and y. Here's an example:

```
// Creating a single cubic bezier curve. 
svg.create('path').set({ d: 'M 75,75 C 140,330 360,330 425,75' });
```

The preceding path is illustrated in Figure 6-10, where you can see the
initial M point in yellow, and in red, the three points that comprise
the cubic Bezier curve itself. The colored dots and dashed lines are
just for illustrative purposes; these wouldn't be rendered in the final
SVG.

![](./images/media/image49.jpg){width="3.15in" height="2.52in"}

***Figure 6-10.** A cubic Bezier curve with the control points
visualized*

When linked together, consecutive cubic Bezier curves can combine to
create any 2D shape imaginable. They are such a staple of vector drawing
programs that wielding them effectively has become a craft in itself.
Judicious use of these curves and their "handles" (visualized as the
dashed lines in Figure 6-10) can make the difference between smooth,
graceful line art and awkward, clunky clip art.

<h2>S for Symmetry</h2>

Like the quadratic Bezier curve, the cubic Bezier curve has a related
command that can be called if you want to extend the curve with another
that is smoothly connected to it. The command to use for this is S (or s
for relative values). The S command automatically generates a symmetric
control point that mirrors the control point of the preceding curve and
as a result allows us to omit the first set of control point
coordinates.

// Extending a cubic bezier curve with the S command.
svg.create(\'path\').set({ d: \'M 50,150 C 100,250 200,50 250,150 S
400,50 450,150\' });

In Figure 6-11, the faintest of the dashed lines indicates where the S
command has automatically generated a symmetrical control point.

***Figure 6-11.** A smoothly extended cubic Bezier curve*

<h2>Organic Curves</h2>

Let's put the preceding knowledge to use in a composition, the aim of
which will be to create a series of smooth, organic-looking curves. To
this end, our friend Noise will nudge us in the right direction. First,
do the usual and copy the template folder, calling it something like
16-organic-curves. Ensure you have the following imports at the top:

import { SvJs, Gen, Noise } from \'../../node_modules/svjs/src/
index.js\';

The parent SVG and background will then follow, at which point we'll
create some noise-related variables. I'm including a new one here called
amplifier; this will be used when we map the noise value to a new range
(increasing its volume so to speak).

// Noise-related.

let noise = new Noise(); let n = Gen.random(0, 1000); let speed = 0.05;

let amplifier = Gen.random(200, 500);

Next we'll set up variables relating to colors and the curves
themselves, which we'll contain within a group.

// Curve and colour-related. let curves = svg.create(\'g\'); let
numCurves = Gen.random(75, 125); let hue = Gen.random(0, 360);

It's generally good practice to group your variables meaningfully in
this manner, with some comments to add clarity. Otherwise when you later
revisit your code, you might have a hard time working out your original
intentions. You could go a step further and group them via objects (a
technique outlined in Chapter 2), but I won't do that here.

We'll move on to the loop next, where we'll first retrieve and then
re-map our noise into a more fit-for-purpose range (using the
aforementioned amplifier variable). Notice here that the range will span
positive and negative values, so we won't know the polarity in advance.
In the case of our curves, this will help us mimic a more organic
movement, as the values won't always be uniformly offset from the
original starting point, but wrap around them more naturally. Outside
the loop, include the moveTo() method to center-align our curve group.
for (let i = 0; i \< numCurves; i += 1) {

// Retrieve and map our noise value.

let noiseValue = noise.get(n);

noiseValue = Gen.map(noiseValue, -1, 1, -amplifier,

> amplifier, false);

}

curves.moveTo(500, 500);

Next come the curve coordinates. For clarity, we'll set variables for
each command we call, to make the construction of the path data (or d
string) less unwieldy. Continue with the following code, keeping it
within the loop. The shape of the curve we're aiming for isn't too
dissimilar to the one shown in Figure 6-10. Other than that, the values
provided are fairly arbitrary, so feel free to tweak them.

// M command co-ordinates. let mx = 0; let my = 0 + (i \* 5);

// C command co-ordinates. let cpx1 = 0 + noiseValue; let cpy1 = -100;
let cpx2 = 250 + noiseValue; let cpy2 = -100; let x2 = 300; let y2 = 0;

// S command co-ordinates. let spx = 350 + noiseValue; let spy = 100;
let x3 = 300; let y3 = -50;

With the exception of the initial M command coordinates, we're going to
build out our curves using relative coordinates (i.e., we'll feed the
preceding curve variables to the c and s commands rather than to their
uppercase brethren). These tend to work better in a loop setting, as
they always remain in step with the most recent coordinate values. The
only other point to note is that we're being quite selective with which
values are being modulated by our noiseValue variable, three out of a
possible ten in this case. Sometimes subtlety works best, but again,
feel free to experiment here.

With our variables in place, it's time to create the curve itself. I'll
introduce a new technique here with regard to the use of template
literal syntax. In previous sketches, we've been opening and closing our
braces \${} for each variable. When these variables follow one after the
other however, we can actually embed them all at once as an array.

// Create the organic curve. curves.create(\'path\').set({ fill:
\'none\', stroke: \`hsl(\${hue} 80% 80% / 0.8)\`, d: \`M \${\[mx, my\]}
c \${\[cpx1, cpy1, cpx2, cpy2, x2, y2\]} s \${\[spx, spy, x3, y3\]}\`

});

If you run the sketch at this point, you'll see a series of curves
alright, but their shape and color will remain uniform throughout. We
haven't yet incremented our noise coordinate value -- a vital step, but
one all too easy to forget (I've omitted this line numerous times
myself, leading to many a head-scratching moment). We'll take care of
this step next and also increase the hue while we're at it, modulating
it slightly via the noiseValue variable. As a final flourish, we'll
throw in some randomized "bubbles" (see Figure 6-12). Don't ask me why.

// Increment the noise and hue. n += speed; hue = (hue % 360) +
(noiseValue / 25);

// 10% chance of spawning a \'bubble\'. if (Gen.chance(10)) {
svg.create(\'circle\').set({ r: Gen.random(5, 50), cx: Gen.random(150,
850), cy: Gen.random(150, 850), fill: \`hsl(0 0% 100% / 0.1)\`, stroke:
\'#888\'

});

}

<h2>An Easier Option</h2>

Having to juggle six coordinates for every curve segment (or four when
we use the S command) can get a little trying at times. Wouldn't it be
nice to be able to connect a series of single points with a smooth
curve, without having to worry about all those extra control points?

Glad you asked! SvJs comes equipped with a method called createCurve()
that can do just this. Under the hood, it harnesses the power of the
cubic Bezier curve but abstracts away the control points so that
constructing a curve is a less intimidating affair. This does sacrifice
a large degree of control, but in some cases, we may not need the level
of fine-tuning that the manual curve commands offer. With the
createCurve() method, all we need to worry about are the points.

// The syntax of the createCurve() method. createCurve(pointsArray,
\[curveFactor\]);

In crude terms, we can think of this as a join-the-dots method, the main
difference being that we need to supply the dots rather than do the
joining. The first argument, pointsArray, is, as the name suggests, an
array of \[x, y\] coordinate pairs. It can be supplied as either a
standard one- dimensional array or as a two-dimensional array (i.e., an
array of arrays).

// A one-dimensional array of points. let points1D = \[25, 30, 45, 20,
80, 10, 90, 40\];

// A two-dimensional array of the same points. let points2D = \[

\[25, 30\], \[45, 20\], \[80, 10\], \[90, 40\]

\];

The curveFactor argument allows us to modify the tension between the
points. At a value of 0, the points are connected by a straight line. At
a value of 1 (the default), the tension is looser and the curve much
smoother. In general, the most usable results lie in the range of 0 to
2; stray too far beyond that and the underlying control points will
overlap and create some truly chaotic squiggles. On certain occasions
though, this may be what you want.

In Figure 6-13, we can see the aforementioned curveFactor values in
action. The uppermost curve is set to 0, the middle curve to 1, and the
bottom curve to 5. The faint dots indicate where our pointsArray
coordinates are positioned and are shown for illustrative purposes only;
you wouldn't see these rendered normally.

our sketches interactive.

**CHAPTER 7**

**Motion and Interactivity**

One characteristic that tends to distinguish generative art from other
art forms is its ability to incorporate interactivity, and, as a result,
active audience participation. This audience -- whether it be a single
user on a laptop or a small crowd at an art installation -- can then
influence, or even determine, the end result. In essence, such art is
*dynamic*; it moves; it responds; it flows. It isn't fixed and final.

In this chapter, we'll explore some of the underlying techniques of
interactive art, including event listeners, callback functions, cursor
tracking, collision detection, and how to use these to alter our SVG
elements and attributes in real time. We'll also delve into the
different methods that can be used to animate SVG and discuss their
strengths and weaknesses before deciding on the method we'll adopt for
the remainder of the chapter.

**Event Listeners**

A mouse click is an event, as is hitting a key on your keyboard, or
tapping your tablet's touchscreen display. When events like this occur
in the context of a web browser, as JavaScript programmers, we can prick
up our virtual ears and listen out for them. And as soon as an event is
detected, we can capture it. What we do once we've captured an event is
up to us.

Â© David Matthew 2024 167

D. Matthew, *Generative Art with JavaScript and SVG*, Design Thinking,
<https://doi.org/10.1007/979-8-8688-0086-3_7>

We could use it to trigger any number of things -- a custom message, a
color change, a simple animation, a complex transformation; the
possibilities are endless. But first we need to know how to "listen."

Thankfully this is straightforward: we can utilize a browser-native
function called addEventListener(). This function needs three things:
one, an element to attach itself to (i.e., the element that will do the
listening); two, the event type to listen out for (e.g., a mouse click);
and three, what to do when it hears it (i.e., the action performed by
the callback function). It takes the following form:

// Adding an event listener to a HTML or SVG element.
element.addEventListener(\'eventType\', doSomething);

We are assuming here that the callback function doSomething() is defined
elsewhere in the code. Note that in this case it is supplied by name
only, without the parentheses. This is so that the function doesn't
trigger prematurely. The situation is different with anonymous -- or
arrow -- functions, which can be defined there and then without the
danger of being immediately invoked.

// Using arrow syntax to define the callback function.

element.addEventListener(\'eventType\', () =\> {

// do something here\...

});

<h2>Event Types</h2>

There are numerous types of events we can choose to listen out for, but
we will focus on a small subset useful for generative art: keyboard,
form, and pointer event types.

Keyboard event types like keydown and keyup capture the different phases
of hitting a key as you type. Form event types like change and input can
capture updates to interface elements for inputting data, such as
sliders, text fields, and drop-downs. And pointer event types, perhaps
the most significant of the lot where generative art is concerned, are a
more modern alternative to mouse and touchscreen event types that aim to
be more hardware-agnostic. Pointer event types include pointerdown,
pointermove, pointerover, and pointerup, and for our purposes, we can
also consider the click event type -- technically a mouse event -- as
falling under this umbrella, as it can also capture simple touch events
like a finger tap.

// Capturing the movement of a mouse, stylus or finger over an element.

element.addEventListener(\'pointermove\', () =\> {

// do something here\...

});

<h2>Event Parameters</h2>

When an event listener is attached to an element and captures an event,
that event can then be passed to the callback function as an argument.
For example, if we were to add an event listener to our HTML
document.body to detect click events, the properties of that click event
would also be captured and could be put to use by the callback function.

Here's how this could work in practice. In the following code, the
position of the mouse or pointer device is logged to the console each
time you click anywhere within the body of the HTML page.

// Log the user\'s pointer co-ordinates on click.

document.body.addEventListener(\'click\', (event) =\> { let x =
event.clientX; let y = event.clientY;

console.log(\`x: \${x}, y: \${y}\`);

});

The clientX and clientY properties are just a couple of the many
properties built into a click event. The full list can be found over at
MDN

[(developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element/click_event](http://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element/click_event)),
including comprehensive documentation covering the full range of DOM
events.

<h2>Triggering the SvJs Save Method</h2>

Say we have a sketch we're happy with, and we wanted to save the actual
SVG markup generated by our JavaScript -- how would we go about it?
Perhaps the quickest way is to open up our browser's developer tools,
select the Elements tab, and inspect the DOM tree until we locate the
root SVG element. Then we can right-click it, select "Copy", and choose
the nested "Copy outerHTML" option. This gives us the SVG file data that
we want, but not the file itself, so as a final step, we need to open up
a text or code editor, paste our clipboard contents into it, and *then*
save it as an SVG file. Not exactly convenient.

It would be far easier to just hit a key on our keyboard and have the
process happen automatically. SvJs does has a save() method that can be
used for this purpose, but it first needs to be "wired up" to an event
listener in order to fire. Let's do this now.

Open up any one of our previous sketches, and at the bottom of the
sketch, let's write a function to call this method whenever we hit the
"s" key. The event type will be keydown, which is triggered when any key
is pressed, so we need to make sure we pass the event as an argument to
our callback function so that we can query its key property; this is
what tells us the actual key that was pressed. We'll trigger the save()
method only when that key is equal to "s", irrespective of case
(allowing us to capture the capital "S" too).

// Save the root svg as a downloadable file.

document.addEventListener(\'keydown\', (event) =\> { let key =
event.key.toLowerCase(); if (key === \'s\') svg.save();

});

Feel free to use the aforementioned for any sketch going forward. And
incidentally, the save() method can be called on any SVG element,
meaning you can save just a portion of your SVG if you prefer -- though
the use cases for this are rarer.

**Creative Cursor Tracking**

In our first example of an event listener in action, we showed how
tracking the mouse cursor might be achieved. We simply had to query the
clientX and clientY coordinates of the mouse event. This was purposely
simplified, as accurately tracking the position of our mouse relative to
the SVG viewport (which uses its own coordinate space) is a bit
trickier.

<h2>The SvJs trackCursor( ) Method</h2>

To solve this, SvJs has a built-in trackCursor() method that can be
called on the root SVG element. It automatically takes care of attaching
the relevant event listeners (pointermove and pointerleave),
transforming the cursor position into the viewBox coordinate space, and
ensuring the expected behavior also occurs with touchscreen devices. To
activate it, it just needs to be called on the main SVG element as
follows:

svg.trackCursor();

Once activated, it updates two properties of the parent SVG: cursorX and
cursorY, which tell us where in the viewBox (rather than the web browser
window) our cursor is currently located. It also allows us to pass in
our own custom callback function, to be triggered each time the cursor
position is updated.

// Passing in a custom callback.

svg.trackCursor(() =\> {

// \... do stuff

});

<h2>Interactive Ellipses</h2>

Let's set up a new sketch to show how trackCursor() can be put to
creative use. Copy our template folder and call it something like
17-cursor-tracking. We're going to re-create a variation of our very
first sketch from Chapter 1, but this time we'll make it interactive.

Below the background, initialize the following variables. The ellipses
array is a new addition; we'll use this to store the created ellipses so
we can iterate through them afterward.

// Randomise some variables. let hue = Gen.random(0, 360); let rotation
= Gen.random(0, 360); let iterations = Gen.random(50, 100);

// This array will allow us to iterate through our ellipses later. let
ellipses = \[\];

Now for the loop to create the ellipses. The code here is more compact
than that presented in the first chapter, as we've since covered more
concise ways of achieving certain results (like incrementing our hue).
Another difference of note is the addition of the ellipses.push()
method; this is where we add each ellipse to the aforementioned array.

// Run a loop a random number of times to create the ellipses. for (let
i = 0; i \< iterations; i += 1) {

// Create our ellipse.

let ellipse = svg.create(\'ellipse\'); ellipse.set({ cx: 500, cy: 500,
rx: 100 + (i \* 3),

ry: 300 + (i \* 2), fill: \'none\', stroke: \`hsl(\${hue} 80% 80% /
0.6)\`, transform: \`rotate(\${rotation + (i \* 2)} 500 500)\` });

// Add the ellipse to the array. ellipses.push(ellipse);

// Increment the hue. hue = (hue % 360) + 2; }

You should now see a static arrangement of ellipses. Our next step is
make them dynamic. What we'll do is activate the trackCursor() method on
the main SVG and pass in an arrow function as a callback. Inside this
arrow function, we'll iterate through each item in the ellipses array
using a forEach() loop and adjust the cx and cy coordinates of each
ellipse relative to our cursor position.

// Adjust the centre point of each ellipse relative to our cursor.

svg.trackCursor(() =\> { ellipses.forEach((ellipse) =\> { ellipse.set({
cx: svg.cursorX, cy: svg.cursorY

});

});

});

And with this, we have movement -- our ellipses glide gracefully into
life as we create a truly dynamic cursor-guided composition! Figure 7-1
illustrates one possible variation with the cursor just south of center.
A keymapped save function is particularly useful here (I used it myself
to save down Figure 7-1), as it allows us to capture our SVG without
disturbing the composition with inadvertent cursor movement (as might
happen if we had to click a button).

***Figure 7-1.** A cursor-transformed array of ellipses*

Now that we know how to achieve movement via interactivity, it's time to
learn how to make things move independently of our input.

**Programming Motion**

As mentioned previously, we have several different methods at our
disposal for animating SVG. The first one we'll explore is CSS
keyframes, which will be familiar territory to most web developers. The
second is the method native to the SVG format itself -- SMIL. The third
is the Web Animations API (or WAAPI), which is a modern
JavaScript-driven API. And the final method is a technique popular among
generative artists (of the

JavaScript variety at least): the recursive requestAnimationFrame
method.

Knowledge of each technique and their respective strengths and
weaknesses should serve you well, irrespective of which one we proceed
with. We'll set up a simple sketch that will showcase, in a very
rudimentary way, all four options. When you're ready, set up a new
instance of our template sketch and call it something like
18-making-things-move.

What we're going to do is create a diamond shape comprised of four
overlaid squares of different dimensions (as shown in Figure 7-2) and
animate each one using a different technique. The following code sets
things up, and apart from the transform_origin attribute (which will
ensure more consistent animation behavior across the various methods by
setting a default point of rotation), there's nothing really new here,
so feel free to simply copy and paste:

import { SvJs } from \'../../node_modules/svjs/src/index.js\';

// Parent SVG. const svg = new SvJs().addTo(document.
getElementById(\'container\'));

// Viewport and viewBox (1:1 aspect ratio). const svgSize =
Math.min(window.innerWidth, window.

innerHeight);

svg.set({ width: svgSize, height: svgSize, viewBox: '0 0 1000 1000' });

// Background.

svg.create(\'rect\').set({ x: 0, y: 0, width: 1000, height: 1000, fill:
\'#181818\'

});

// Arrays to contain our shapes and their colours.

let palette = \[\'#34d399\',\'#6ee7b7\',\'#a7f3d0\', \'#d1fae5\'\]; let
shapes = \[\];

// Initialise our four shapes. for (let i = 0; i \< 4; i += 1) { let
size = 500 - (i \* 125); let position = 250 + (i \* 62.5); let shape =
svg.create(\'rect\').set({ x: position, y: position, width: size,
height: size, fill: palette\[i\], transform_origin: \'50% 50%\',
transform: \'rotate(45)\'

});

shapes.push(shape);

}

***Figure 7-2.** The four shapes we\'ll make move*

<h2>CSS Keyframes</h2>

Animated sequences can be created with CSS using a \@keyframes rule.
Much like traditional keyframes used in animation, motion graphics, and
video editing software, CSS \@keyframes define the state of certain
properties at a particular point in time (or step in a sequence). For
example, at time t, our subject might be at position \[x1, y1\], and at
time t + 5, the subject might have moved to \[x2, y2\]. Keyframes define
these points in time, and the transition between one state and another
is what constitutes the animation. We call this process "tweening"
(meaning "inbetweening"), as the animation occurs in these inbetween
states.

The syntax for CSS \@keyframes is quite self-explanatory. You can set
the start and end keyframes of a simple animation with from and to
directives, or if you have something a little more complex in mind, you
can use percentages to specify the point at which certain transitions
should trigger. Once the \@keyframes rule is defined, it then needs to
be called by an element using the animation-name property, and we also
need to specify how long the animation should take (the
animation-duration). There are other optional properties that we can
define, such as the animation-timingfunction (also known as easing),
which describes *how* we transition from one property value to another,
and the animation-iteration- count, which specifies how many times our
animation should play.

In the following code, we're calling the first shape of our array and
assigning it an id of cssShape. This will enable us to easily target the
element later. We then set up a \@keyframes rule called scaleRotate that
rotates its target a full 360 degrees, while simultaneously scaling it
down along its x axis and up along its y axis (creating a stretching
effect) before returning it to its original dimensions. And finally we
assign the animation to the cssShape element, specifying the duration,
iteration count, and timing function.

```
// Set an id for our first shape. shapes\[0\].set({ id: \'cssShape\' });
// Animate this shape with CSS. svg.create(\'style\').content(\`
@keyframes scaleRotate {
0% { transform: rotate(0) scale(1, 1) }
50% { transform: rotate(180deg) scale(0.5, 1.5) }
100% { transform: rotate(360deg) scale(1, 1) }
}
#cssShape {
animation-name: scaleRotate; animation-duration: 5s;
animation-iteration-count: infinite; animation-timing-function: linear;
}
`);
```

You should now see our outer square slowly rotate and stretch, while the
others remain static. It's also possible to use the shorthand animation
property, which allows for greater concision by declaring all our
animation values at once. Only use this when familiar with the longhand
version though, as the order of values -- while not especially strict --
can lead to unanticipated behavior if you're not familiar with all the
possible values that can be accepted.

```
svg.create('style').content(` ...
  #cssShape {
    animation: scaleRotate 5s infinite linear;
  }
`);
```

<h2>The SMIL Way</h2>

Now let's try to achieve the same thing with SMIL. SMIL, which stands
for Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language, is the animation
method native to SVG itself, requiring no CSS or JavaScript. However, as
we're using SvJs, we will be interfacing with SMIL via JavaScript.
Before we do so however, here's a quick peek at how it looks in its
original form.

```
<circle cx="50" cy="50" r="25" fill="red">
  <animate attributeName="r" from="25" to="40" dur="2s"
    repeatCount="indefinite" />
</circle>
```

As you can see, the animation is an actual SVG element, nested inside
the element it animates (a \<circle\> in this case). The \<animate\>
element takes care of the animation of most SVG attributes, but in the
case of element transforms (i.e., translating, rotating, scaling, or
skewing), an \<animateTransform\> element must be used instead. There is
one other animation element called \<animateMotion\>, reserved for
animating an element along a path. As we will be rotating and scaling
our shape, the \<animateTransform\> element is the one we'll be using.

Each transform requires its own element, making the syntax a little
verbose. With the first transform, namely, the rotation, we specify the
attributeName to animate and its type, rotate. We have just two states
to transition between -- 0 degrees and 360 degrees -- so we can use from
and to directives to cover these. We then set the duration (dur) and
iteration count (repeatCount), and that's the first transform taken care
of.

```
// Rotate the second shape using SMIL.
shapes[1].create('animateTransform').set({ attributeName:
'transform', type: 'rotate', from: '0', to: '360', dur: '5s',
repeatCount: 'indefinite' });
```

The second transform is a little more complicated. It has more than two
states, so instead of the from and to attributes, we have a values
attribute that can store multiple states. In this case, we supply it
with a semicolon-separated list of our transform values. We also need to
include an additional additive attribute with a value of sum so that the
scale transform adds to (and doesn't overwrite) the previous rotate
transform. // Scale the second shape using SMIL.

```
shapes[1].create('animateTransform').set({ attributeName:
'transform', type: 'scale', values: '1 1; 0.5 1.5; 1 1', dur:
'5s', additive: 'sum', repeatCount: 'indefinite' });
```

The second shape should now be slowly rotating and stretching, and the
motion should be perfectly synchronized with our CSS keyframes example.

<h2>The Web Animations API</h2>

The Web Animations API, or WAAPI, is the most modern of the methods
we'll be covering. It is being actively worked on by the W3C (World Wide
Web Consortium) and is intended to provide the future direction for
animation on the Web. In addition to keyframes and timing options, it
supports advanced features such as control over playback rates, flexible
easing functionality, scroll-linked timelines, and the ability to apply
successive animations (or sequences) to the same element.

Elements can be animated with a sensibly named animate() method, which
takes two arguments. The first argument defines the keyframes, and the
second defines the timing options. element.animate(keyframes, options);

The keyframes can be supplied as either an array of objects or an object
containing arrays. And the timing options can be supplied as a single
value -- specifically, an integer defining the length of the animation
in milliseconds -- or as an object containing one or more time-related
properties. Say we wanted to animate the value of a circle's radius r.
The following is how this could be achieved using both syntax formats:

```
// Format one for keyframes.
let keyframes = [
{ r: 25 },
{ r: 40 },
{ r: 25 }
];
// Format two for keyframes.
let keyframes = { r: [25, 40, 25] };

// Format one for timing options. let options = 2000; // 2 seconds.
// Format two for timing options.
let options = { duration: 2000, iterations: Infinity,
// ... etc
};
```

I prefer the second keyframe format as it is more concise in most cases.
Before we implement the rotation and scaling example, there's one more
thing to point out: how the keyframes are spaced out (or offset) from
one another. With CSS keyframes, we need to explicitly state when a
keyframe should trigger by using percentage values or the from and to
directives. With the Web Animations API, the offset of animations is
*inferred* if not explicitly stated. If we have three keyframes, they
will be automatically spaced out at 0, 0.5, and 1, respectively (the
equivalent of 0%, 50%, and 100% in CSS). But we can define custom
offsets if needs be. In the following example, the second keyframe will
trigger at 0.75 instead of the default 0.5.

```
// Explicitly defining offsets.
let keyframes = { r: [25, 40, 25], offset: [0, 0.75, 1] };
```

Let's get back to our sketch now and implement the rotation and scaling
of our third shape using the WAAPI method. Below our SMIL
implementation, set up the animation as follows.

```
let keyframes = { transform: [
'rotate(0deg) scale(1, 1)',
'rotate(180deg) scale(0.5, 1.5)',
'rotate(360deg) scale(1, 1)'
]
};
let options = { duration: 5000, iterations: Infinity };
shapes[2].animate(keyframes, options);
```

Now all but one of our shapes should be on the move. Note how similar
the WAAPI keyframes syntax is to our CSS keyframes example; this isn't
by accident. The Web Animations API is essentially a further development
of and extension to preexisting web animation standards so that web
developers familiar with CSS animation should find the syntax intuitive
and (mostly) compatible with what they already know. Having a native,
high-level JavaScript API to create animations in the browser has opened
up possibilities previously only attainable through the use of third-
party libraries, but it isn't the only game in town where native
JavaScript animation techniques are concerned.

<h2>The requestAnimationFrame( ) Method</h2>

Meet the requestAnimationFrame() method, a low-level recursive technique
that allows us to tap into the browser's screen repainting process. This
is a very different approach from the methods we've covered previously;
it is at the same time very simple and very complex. By calling a single
method over and over again (this is the recursive part), we are handed
full, fine-grained control over the entire animation process -- but this
also means we have to do everything ourselves. Concepts like keyframes
and timing options don't really apply at this level.

The requestAnimationFrame() method must be called within a custom
function we define, which contains the code we want to run on a
per-frame basis. We then pass this custom function as an argument to
requestAnimationFrame, so it is called recursively on each screen
repaint. Here's a basic example of how this works.

```
// Define the function.
function customFunction() { // do stuff here...
// Make the recursive call to requestAnimationFrame()).
requestAnimationFrame(customFunction); }
// Call the function.
customFunction();
```

Additionally, requestAnimationFrame() can pass a timestamp to our custom
function so that we can sync our animation with real-time values rather
than relying on the screen refresh rate, which can vary from device to
device. The timestamp contains the amount of milliseconds that have
elapsed since our animation started. Let's continue now with our sketch
and set up an animate() function and pass it the timestamp so that we
can use it to increment the angle of rotation. This works because
rotation values can increment indefinitely beyond 360Â° and still remain
valid.

```
// Animate the last shape using requestAnimationFrame. function
animate(time) {
// Rotate the angle. let angle = time;
// Apply the rotation.
shapes[3].set({ transform: `rotate(${angle})` });
// The recursive bit.
requestAnimationFrame(animate); } animate();
```

Ok, so this code gets our final shape moving, but we've got a couple of
problems. One, our shape is rotating at a breakneck speed, wildly out of
sync with the others. And two, if you inspect the console, you'll see an
error to the effect that we're supplying an undefined variable to our
rotation transform. This error occurs just the once, so what that tells
us is that when our function runs for the first time, the angle (and
therefore the time) is undefined. This is simple enough to rectify; we
just need to reassign the time variable to a value of 0 if it is
undefined. Include the following code before the angle is declared, and
that should soothe our console's concerns:

```
// Prevent errors when the time is undefined on first frame.
if (time === undefined) time = 0;
```

Now let's address the speed of rotation. We could try dividing the time
by arbitrary amounts until it slows down to the point of synchronization
(or something close enough), but that's not very satisfactory. Instead,
let's work with what we know:

-   Our shape should rotate by 360Â°.

-   This rotation should take five seconds (or five thousand
    milliseconds).

-   The time is provided in milliseconds.

Based on the aforementioned, we can derive a calculation that gives us
the exact speed by which to rotate our shape: 0.072Â° per millisecond
(360Â° divided by 5,000 milliseconds). Update the previous statement
where angle simply equals time with the following:

```
// Rotate 360Â° in 5000ms: 360/5000 = 0.072. let angle = time * 0.072;
```

This should rotate our shape in sync with the others. Getting it to
scale in sync, however, is more of a challenge. For that, we first need
to initialize some variables outside of the animation loop that can help
us keep track of certain states. Why? Well, if we tried creating these
states inside the loop, they would get overwritten on each iteration.

The scale increment value needs to swing back and forth between an upper
and a lower limit, and the most straightforward way to achieve this is
to keep track of the current scale value and its polarity (i.e., whether
it's swinging one way or another). For this, we'll need a boolean that
we can toggle back and forth like a switch. We'll also need a way to
increment the scale value in a way that synchronizes with the time but
doesn't use the timestamp value directly as this would only increment it
indefinitely.

With the aforementioned in mind, let's initialize the following
variables before the animate() function:

```
let isPositive = true;
let scale = 0, tick = 0, prevTime = 0;
```

Update the animation loop as follows. The comments do the explanatory
heavy-lifting here, so to better understand each step, be sure to read
the comments carefully. The main takeaway here is just how much more
work we need to do with requestAnimationFrame() compared to the other
methods.

```
// Animate the final shape using requestAnimationFrame. 
function animate(time) {
// Prevent errors when the time is undefined on first frame. 
if (time === undefined) time = 0;
// Rotate 360Â° in 5000ms: 360/5000 = 0.072. 
let angle = time * 0.072;
// We need a constant tick value that doesn't increment indefinitely.
tick = time - prevTime;
// Scale by 0.5 in 2500ms: 0.5/2500 = 0.0002.
scale = isPositive ? scale + (tick * 0.0002) : scale - (tick * 0.0002);
// Apply the rotation and scale values. 
shapes[3].set({
  transform: `rotate(${angle}) scale(${1 - scale}, ${1 + scale})`
});
// Flip the polarity if the scale value falls outside these bounds.
if (scale < 0 || scale > 0.5) isPositive = !isPositive;
// Capture the time before it increments. 
prevTime = time;
// The recursive bit.
requestAnimationFrame(animate); }
animate();
```

We should now have the final shape rotating and scaling in sync (give or
take) with the other shapes. In some cases, you might see some slight
offset in the rotation, or the scaling might happen a little quicker
than expected. Discrepancies like this have more to do with how the
browser automatically schedules and handles optimizations with the other
animation methods than it has to do with the performance of
requestAnimationFrame() itself. These animation methods weren't designed
to be combined as we've done in this sketch; normally you'll choose one
method and stick to it, depending on what you're trying to achieve.

<h2>Methods Summarized</h2>

So which method should you choose for generative art? There's no
definitive answer to this, but for what it's worth, here's my advice
(with the caveat that this is not a comprehensive analysis of the pros
and cons of each method, but a cursory comparison from my inevitably
partisan point of view).

CSS keyframes are more suited to shorter sequences, such as animated
loading indicators (an art in themselves), UX enhancements, and
animations where accessibility or browser compatibility is a concern.
For more elaborate sequences, they can quickly get convoluted and
awkward to edit. For animating SVG specifically, there are many
attributes that are inaccessible when using CSS, such as masks, clip
paths, and gradients.

With SMIL, you've got a well-thought-out animation format native to SVG
and one that can access all animation-capable attributes. Unlike the
other methods, it can also retain its animations when the SVG is
embedded as an image (much like a gif). The negatives? It can become
quite verbose, and its future is rather unclear (back in 2015, support
for SMIL was dropped from Chrome, but this decision was quickly
reversed).

The Web Animations API, or WAAPI, is the most modern animation method,
has more advanced capabilities than CSS or SMIL, and in general is more
flexible and concise. I would recommend it over CSS or SMIL for
generative art, but it does have its limitations. It's not suitable for
open-ended, exploratory animations, where we're unsure of the end
result. Like CSS and SMIL, everything needs to be tightly orchestrated
and intentional. To go "full generative," we need something more low
level like requestAnimationFrame().

Yes, requestAnimationFrame() can make us trudge a rather punishing path
to achieve relatively meager results, but conversely, more complicated
results can in many cases be achieved in a far more simple and elegant
manner than they can using other methods (I'll demonstrate this in our
next example on collision detection). We just need to persevere beyond
the initial pain barrier.

It's also worth noting that there are many solid third-party libraries
out there to help you animate with SVG; of particular note is the
GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP), which is very feature rich and
offers robust performance and impressive backward compatibility. It's
not open source however, and some of its plug-ins are for paid
subscribers only. Anime.js is a nice open source alternative.

**Collision Detection**

It's one thing to interact ourselves with a generative piece to
influence the output, but it's another thing entirely when it begins to
interact with *itself*. This is in essence what collision detection
entails. We'll explore an example using the bounds of a rectangle as a
basic collision barrier, and we'll utilize the requestAnimationFrame()
method while it's still relatively fresh in our minds.

<h2>Setting Boundaries</h2>

So the usual drill -- create a new folder from the template, rename it
to

19-collision-detection, and begin coding below the background. The
first thing we'll do is create a rect styled like a picture frame. This
effect is achieved by using a slightly transparent stroke over the fill;
half the stroke is painted outside the frame and half inside (something
we'll need to factor into our collision detection calculations later).
The size of this frame will be randomized, so we'll set up a frameSize
variable to capture this and also use it to keep other element (like the
stroke-width) in proportion.

```
// Create a frame to act as the boundary.
let frameSize = Gen.random(350, 700); let frame =
svg.create('rect').set({ x: (1000 - frameSize) / 2, y: (1000 -
frameSize) / 2, width: frameSize, height: frameSize, fill: '#252525',
stroke: `hsl(${Gen.random(0, 360)} 80% 80% / 0.25)`, stroke_width:
frameSize / 10,
});
```

<h2>Initializing and Extending Our Shapes</h2>

With the frame now in place, let's fill it with some circles of various
sizes. The aim will be to have these circles burst out from the center
in all directions, some rushing rapidly and others ambling slowly, and
all of them bouncing off the frame borders as they encounter them. In
the following, we'll start by initializing the circles and filling up an
array as we've done in our previous examples.

```
// Randomise the number of circles and set up an empty array. 
let numCircles = Math.floor(frameSize / 20); 
let circles = [];

// Populate this array. 
for (let i = 0; 
  i < numCircles; i += 1) {

    // Randomise the radius relative to the frame size.
    let radius = Gen.random(frameSize / 100, frameSize / 25);

    // Apply the above variables and randomise the hue.
    let circle = svg.create('circle').set({ 
	  cx: 500, 
	  cy: 500, 
	  r: radius,
      fill: `hsl(${Gen.random(0, 360)} 80% 80% / 0.5)` 
	});
	
    // Store the circle in the array.
    circles.push(circle); 
  }
```

We have our circles all clustered in the center now, but they're not yet
primed for movement. We have a way to track their position (via the cx
and cy attributes), but we have no attributes to track their speed or
direction, which we'll need if we're going to pull off collision
detection.

Thankfully SvJs elements are easily extendable. If we want to add a new
attribute to an element, it's as simple as including it in the set()
method. If it's not a valid SVG attribute, it won't have any impact on
the rendered SVG, but that's ok -- we simply want it stored to be used
in our collision detection calculations later.

We'll need at least two new attributes: one to track the speed on the x
axis and another to track the speed on the y axis. To determine
direction, we can use these same attributes and invert the polarity to
change the direction. For example, positive numbers on the x axis will
indicate left- to- right motion, and negative numbers will mean
right-to-left motion. On the y axis, positive numbers will denote
downward motion and negative numbers upward motion.

Setting these new attributes will be a two-step process. We'll first set
up variables velocityX and velocityY to capture randomized speeds. And
the attributes we'll set will be simply vx and vy, and we'll randomize
their polarity using Gen.chance() (so they'll have a 50/50 chance of
being either positive or negative). Update the relevant code as follows:

```
// Create variables to control the speed on the x and y axes.
let velocityX = Gen.random(0.1, 5, true); 
let velocityY = Gen.random(0.1, 5, true);

// Apply the above variables and randomise the hue.
let circle = svg.create('circle').set({ 
  cx: 500, 
  cy: 500, 
  r: radius,
  vx: Gen.chance() ? velocityX : -velocityX, 
  vy: Gen.chance() ? velocityY : -velocityY, 
  fill: `hsl(${Gen.random(0, 360)} 80% 80% / 0.5)`
});
```

<h2>Frame-by-Frame Calculations</h2>

Calculating whether or not one of our circles collides with a boundary
(i.e., the edge of our frame) involves keeping a constant check on each
circle's position. For this reason, requestAnimationFrame() is really
the only feasible way to simulate collision detection, as these checks
need to occur on a frame-by-frame basis.

There's a bit of a code dump coming up, but I'll explain the important
parts. You'll notice that when we fetch any of our attributes, we're
wrapping them in a Number() method. This is because our attributes will
be returned as strings, and if we're to do any reliable calculations
with them, we want to explicitly handle them as numeric values rather
than relying on JavaScript's covert casting (which may sometimes get
things right, but it leaves you wide open to bugs).

Here's a rundown of the algorithm we'll implement. First, we calculate
the lower and upper bounds (i.e., the frame edges). Then, for each
circle:

-   We retrieve the position and velocity and store them as variables.

-   If the x variable is less than or equal to either the lower bound or
    the upper bound, we reverse the polarity of the x velocity variable.

-   We repeat the previous step for the y axis.

-   We then update the x and y variables based on the calculated
    velocity.

-   Finally, we apply the updated variables to the circle element.

<h4> Here's the concrete coded version:</h4>

```
// Get the lower and upper bounds (the frame edges) for use in the loop.
let lowerBound = Number(frame.get('x'));
let upperBound = lowerBound + frameSize;

// The animation loop. 
function animate() {

  // Check collisions for each circle. 
  circles.forEach((circle) => {

    // Retrieve the position and velocity.
    let cx = Number(circle.get('cx')); 
	let cy = Number(circle.get('cy')); 
	let vx = Number(circle.get('vx')); 
	let vy = Number(circle.get('vy'));

    // Check for collisions, and if found reverse the polarity.
    if (cx <= lowerBound || cx >= upperBound) vx = -vx; 
	if (cy <= lowerBound || cy >= upperBound) vy = -vy;

    // Update the position.
    cx += vx; 
	cy += vy;

    // Set the new values. 
	circle.set({ cx: cx, cy: cy, vx: vx, vy: vy });
  });

  // The recursive bit.
  requestAnimationFrame(animate); 
}

// Call the animation.
animate();
```

If you watch the animation at this point, you'll notice that the circles
do indeed rebound within the vicinity of the frame edge, but it's far
from precise and even appears to differ depending on the circle size.
Looks like we've left something out of our calculations.

To fix this, we need to account for the fact that the frame border is
inset; that is, the stroke is halfway inside the frame, and the radius
of each circle is different. This means that the lower bound and upper
bound variables must be calculated *inside* the animation loop, as they
will vary per circle. There are, however, a couple of static values that
can be captured outside the loop and used later inside it: the frame
edge and frame inset. Delete the lower bound and upper bound variables
and replace them with the following:

```
// Get the frame edge point (x or y) and the inset.
let frameEdge = Number(frame.get('x'));
let frameInset = Number(frame.get('stroke-width')) / 2;
```

Now, inside the loop, we can work out the proper lower bound and upper
bound values.

```
// The animation loop. 
function animate() {

  // Check collisions for each circle. 
  circles.forEach((circle) => {

    // Calculate the lower and upper bounds for each circle. 
	let radius = Number(circle.get('r')); 
	let lowerBound = frameEdge + radius + frameInset; 
	let upperBound = frameEdge + frameSize - radius -
    frameInset;
	
    // ... remainder of code is unchanged.
}
```

This should result in accurate collision detection; Figure 7-3 shows a
freezeframe of this in action. There are a lot of ways you could take
this further -- add noise into the mix, see if you can incorporate
cursor tracking, or change the colors over time. As it is however, we've
taken the first steps on the road to full-on physics simulations (a
topic way beyond the scope of this book, but I'd encourage you to
explore it independently).

***Figure 7-3.** Colorful collision detection*

**Circularity**

We'll round off the chapter with a return to the JavaScript Web
Animations API. We'll touch on trigonometry in the process, but only
tangentially (if you got that pun, you're doing well!), as the main
focus will be to provide you with some inspiration, not laden you with
complicated math.

Let's create a new example folder called 20-circular-loop, copying our
template folder. The aim will be to create a looping animation
consisting of circles that are themselves arranged in a circle; these
kinds of animations hold high hypnotic potential. We'll start in the
usual place below our background, initializing some randomized
variables.

```
// Randomise some variables.
let numCircles = Gen.random(20, 35); 
let baseRadius = Gen.random(5, 25, true); 
let hue = Gen.random(0, 360);
```

We'll use numCircles to control how many times our loop runs and also in
the calculations needed to distribute these circles. The baseRadius and
hue we'll use as starter values. For now, create the loop and the
circles as follows, omitting the cx and cy attributes (which we'll work
out in the next section).

```
// Set up the loop. 
for (let i = 0; i < numCircles; i += 1) {

  // Create the circle, but don't set the position or radius yet. 
  let circle = svg.create('circle').set({ 
    r: baseRadius, 
	fill: 'none',
    stroke: `hsl(${hue} 80% 80% / 0.75)`, 
	transform_origin: '500 500'
  });
}
```

<h2>Slices of PI</h2>

Here comes the trigonometry tangent we mentioned earlier. To calculate
the distribution of each of our circles (i.e., their cx and cy
coordinates), we need to draw upon some built-in JavaScript Math methods
and properties. The first is Math.PI, a property that returns the
approximated value of ð (3.14), a mathematical constant that represents
the ratio of a circle's circumference (the length along its perimeter)
to its diameter (double the radius). Figure 7-4 illustrates these
values.

![](./images/media/image56.jpg){width="3.15in" height="3.15in"}

***Figure 7-4.** The circumference, diameter, and radius of a circle*

You may be accustomed to angles being expressed in terms of degrees, but
in JavaScript, angles are measured in radians by default. One radian is
equivalent to the length of a circle's radius wrapped around the
circumference (visualized in Figure 7-5). It takes just over six of
these radians (or approximately 6.28) to wrap around the full
circumference.

And half of 6.28 is ð, or 3.14.

![](./images/media/image57.jpg){width="3.15in" height="3.15in"}

***Figure 7-5.** How radians relate to* ð *and the circumference*

The takeaway? Math.PI radians is equivalent to 180Â°, meaning Math.PI \*
2 gives us a full circle (360Â°). So within the context of our loop,
we're going to increment the angle at which our circles are placed
relative to Math.PI \* 2. And to ensure an equal distribution of our
circles along the circumference, we'll divide Math.PI \* 2 by
numCircles, and each time the loop runs, we'll multiply it by our
iterator to move on to the next "slice," so to speak.

Within the loop, after we define our circle element, include the
following line:

```
// Calculate the current angle.
let angle = Math.PI \* 2 / numCircles \* i;
```

<h2>Sine and Cosine</h2>

Once we have the angle, we need to get the corresponding sine and cosine
values, which you can think of as the x and y coordinates. We won't go
into too much detail here; suffice to say, the methods Math.sin() and
Math.cos() work together perfectly to create circular motion.

```
// Get the sine and cosine of the angle.
let sin = Math.sin(angle); let cos = Math.cos(angle);
```

It's also worth noting that these are extremely useful methods in their
own right, particularly for motion, due to the smooth, oscillating
values they produce. For the current sketch, however, we'll limit
ourselves to using these values to position our circles only, not
animate them. And to position them, we need to map the sine and cosine
values to a more usable range, as they return values between -1 and 1 by
default.

We'll position our circles relative to the center of the viewBox (so 500
on both the x and y axes) and re-map them so that they span a range of
700. This gives us 150 and 850, that is, -350 and +350 either side of
the center.

```
// Map the sine and cosine to the desired range. let cx = Gen.map(sin,
-1, 1, 200, 800, false); let cy = Gen.map(cos, -1, 1, 200, 800, false);
```

<h2>Animating Our Circles</h2>

We can now try our hand at a basic animation. We'll start simple and
move our circles outward from the center toward the cx and cy
coordinates we defined earlier.

```
// Move from (500, 500) to (cx, cy).
circle.animate({
cx: [500, cx, 500], cy: [500, cy, 500],
}, {
duration: 10000, iterations: Infinity, easing: ['ease-in-out'] });
```

This gets things moving, but it's not an especially interesting
sequence. Let's add more variety to it by setting an initial and target
radius, using the iterator value to vary these per circle, and rotating
the entire animation while we're at it. And just before we close out the
loop, let's increment the hue relative to the number of circles to get a
nice color distribution.

```
// Set the initial and target radii. let r1 = baseRadius \* 2 + (i \*
10); let r2 = baseRadius / (i + 10);

// Move from (500, 500) to (cx, cy), reduce the radius, rotate.
circle.animate({ cx: \[500, cx, 500\], cy: \[500, cy, 500\], r: \[r1,
r2, r1\], transform: \[\'rotate(0deg)\', \'rotate(360deg)\'\]
}, {
duration: 10000, iterations: Infinity, easing: \[\'ease-in-out\'\] });
// Increment the hue.
hue = (hue % 360) + (180 / numCircles);
```

There... That gets us much closer to achieving that hypnotic pull. See
Figure 7-6 for a snapshot of this animation at about 15% progression.

**Summary**

This has been perhaps the densest of all chapters so far in terms of
concepts and content, but I hope you've also had some fun following
along. To quickly recap, we've covered the following:

-   Event listeners, event types, and event parameters

-   How to save our SVG markup

-   How to use cursor tracking to make a sketch interactive

-   Animating with CSS keyframes

-   Animating with SMIL

-   The Web Animations API

-   Animating with the requestAnimationFrame() method

-   Basic collision detection

-   Very basic trigonometry

In the next and final full chapter, we'll focus on SVG filters.

<h2 id="ch8">CHAPTER 8: Filter Effects</h2>

In addition to all the vector functionality offered by SVG (as you'd
expect from a format called Scalable Vector Graphics), SVG also provides
some very powerful pixel-based effects in the form of the \<filter\>
element. Many of the kinds of image-manipulation operations routinely
found in editors like GIMP or Photoshop, such as blurs, drop shadows,
and distortions, can actually be carried out in SVG too. In this
chapter, we'll learn how this is done.

We won't be covering the capabilities of SVG filters in any kind of
comprehensive way; that would require at least its own book. It is a
vast subject and one whose creative potential -- at least aesthetically
-- is often neglected. It's very easy to make awful-looking SVG filters.
I'll aim to avoid this pitfall and will be presenting a subset of
filters more from the perspective of the generative artist than the
image editor.

**Filter Fundamentals**

Before we explore specific filter effects in any depth, we need to know
how they're structured. A filter consists of a single \<filter\> element
and one or more filter primitives. These primitives, which are also
elements, are nested within the main filter element, and they all begin
with the letters fe (for filter effect) followed by a descriptive name.
Each performs its own operation(s) and can be connected to other
primitives in a node-like manner using a series of inputs and outputs.

Â© David Matthew 2024 205

D. Matthew, *Generative Art with JavaScript and SVG*, Design Thinking,
<https://doi.org/10.1007/979-8-8688-0086-3_8>

Let's look at a basic example in raw markup form, using just a single
primitive.

```
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 1000 1000">
  <defs>
    <filter id="blur">
    <feGaussianBlur stdDeviation="10" />
    </filter>
  </defs>
  <circle r="350" cx="500" cy="500" fill="yellow"
  filter="url(#blur)" /> 
</svg>
```

As you can see, the \<filter\> element must be nested inside a \<defs\>
element; in common with gradients and patterns, it only gets rendered
when referenced via a url link to its id. In the preceding case, a
yellow circle calls the filter via its own filter attribute, and the
result (shown in Figure 8-1) is a soft blur, controlled by a primitive named feGaussianBlur.

![](./images/media/image59.jpg){width="3.15in" height="3.15in"}

***Figure 8-1.** A blurred circle*

<h2>The Ins and Outs</h2>

Let's inspect a slightly more involved example, this time illustrating
how filter primitives can be connected together. The result will be a
drop shadow applied to a circle's stroke, as shown in Figure 8-2.

```
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 1000 1000">
  <defs>
    <filter id="shadow">
      <feGaussianBlur stdDeviation="25" in="SourceAlpha" result="blur" />
      <feOffset dx="0" dy="50" in="blur" result="offset" />
      <feComposite in="SourceGraphic" in2="offset" />
    </filter>
  </defs>

***Figure 8-2.** A drop-shadow filter effect*

As with the previous example, we're starting off with an feGaussianBlur
primitive, but you'll notice there's a couple of more attributes added:
in and result. These attributes are also present in the primitive
following it, feOffset. In the final filter primitive, feComposite, in
is also present, along with in2. What do these mean?

-   in refers to a filter primitive's input source.

-   in2 refers to a second input source, if the filter primitive
    supports this.

-   result is what we use to label a filter primitive's output, which
    can then be used as the input for another primitive.

If a filter primitive is the first in its chain (as feGaussianBlur is
above), in will default to SourceGraphic; otherwise, it will default to
the result of the preceding primitive. SourceGraphic just means the
graphics element to which a filter is applied. SourceAlpha also refers
to this same graphics element but is restricted to its alpha channel
(i.e., its opacity value). So here's what's happening in this second
example:

1.  The feGaussianBlur primitive takes the

SourceAlpha of the circle as its input and applies a Gaussian blur
effect to it. The result (or output) is then named blur.

2.  The feOffset primitive takes the blur result as its input and
    offsets it along the y axis, and the result of this is labelled
    offset.

3.  The feComposite primitive takes our original SourceGraphic as the
    first input in and the result of offset as its second input in2,
    recombining them.

We'll go into some of these primitives in more detail later, but next
we'll look at how to move from markup to scripting filters with SvJs.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>The SvJs createFilter( ) Method</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

Perhaps unsurprisingly, SvJs has its own createFilter() method to speed
up the filter creation process. It requires just one argument: an id,
and this id is used when applying the filter to the target element. As
with the createGradient() and createPattern() methods, sensible defaults
are initialized, and the checking of whether a defs element already
exists is taken care of under the hood.

The following is the SvJs equivalent of our first example shown
previously, applying a soft blur to a yellow circle (Figure 8-1).

```
// Initialise the filter.
let filter = svg.createFilter('blur');

// Create the blur effect. filter.create('feGaussianBlur').set({
stdDeviation: 10 });

// Apply the filter.
svg.create('circle').set({ r: 350, cx: 500, cy: 500, fill: 'yellow',
filter:
'url(#blur)'
});
```

<h2>The Filter Region</h2>

When a filter is applied to an element, its active region extends beyond
that element. This allows a certain amount of space into which the
effect can "bleed," to use a print analogy. This space is known as the
filter region, and once a filter's effect extends beyond this region,
clipping occurs (see Figure 8-3).

![](./images/image061.jpg){width="3.15in" height="3.15in"}

***Figure 8-3.** A clipped filter region*

In generative art, we'll sometimes stray outside the range of values a
filter effect parameter might anticipate, so it's important to know
about this region if your filter effects are unexpectedly clipped. A
filter region is defined just as a rect element is: by x, y, width, and
height attributes. By default, these values are as follows:

```
<filter x="-10%" y="-10%" width="120%" height="120%">
```

The percentage values are relative to the shape to which the filter is
applied, so in the aforementioned, this translates to a 10% padding
surrounding the filtered element. SvJs enlarges this filter region to
25%, allowing some more room to experiment. If you need to adjust it
further, you can easily do so with the set() method:

```
filter.set({ 
  x: '-15%', 
  y: '-15%', 
  width: '130%', 
  height: '130%' 
});
```

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
**Filter Effects 101**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Let's move on to some simple custom filter effects. We've already seen
the feGaussianBlur primitive in action so I won't give it its own
section here, but it's worth mentioning before I move on that its main
attribute stdDeviation can actually accept two values as well as one. If
you supply two, the first number will control the blur along the x axis
and the second the blur along the y axis.

```
// Create a 'motion' blur effect.
filter.create('feGaussianBlur').set({ stdDeviation: '20 0' });
```

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Shadows</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

We implemented a drop shadow earlier using three connected filter
primitives, but there's actually a much easier way to do this. In a more
recent revision of the SVG spec, the primitive feDropShadow was
introduced, which can accept up to five attributes: dx, which defines
the shadow offset along the x axis; dy, which does the same along the y
axis; stdDeviation, which controls the blurring of the shadow; and two
more optional attributes, flood-colour and flood-opacity, which can
modify the shadow's color and transparency.

Here's how we could rewrite the code for Figure 8-2 using SvJs and the
feDropShadow primitive.

```
// Initialise the filter.
let filter = svg.createFilter('shadow');

// Create the drop shadow.
filter.create('feDropShadow').set({ dx: 0, dy: 50, stdDeviation: 25
});

// Apply the filter.
svg.create('circle').set({

// ... other attributes. 
filter: 'url(#shadow)' });
```

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Coloring</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
We mentioned earlier some attributes called flood-colour and flood-
opacity that can be used with the feDropShadow primitive. There's
another primitive these can also be applied to and to which they
originally belonged: feFlood. The feFlood primitive is very basic; it
requires no input and simply floods the filter region with a specific
color and opacity. By itself, it's not especially interesting, but it
can be useful when combined with other primitives.

Other more capable color-related primitives exist called feColorMatrix
and feComponentTransfer. The latter is too advanced to cover in this
book so we'll limit ourselves to feColorMatrix and feFlood.

Let's set up a sketch and put these to use.

Instead of copying our template folder, let's copy our first grid
example, which I labelled 07-regular-grids (see Chapter 4). Copy and
rename this folder to something like 21-colour-filter. Leaving the rest
of the code as is, replace the body of the nested for loop with the
following:

```
if (Gen.chance(55)) { 
  grid.create('rect').set({ 
    x: x, 
	y: y, 
	width: cellSize, 
    height: cellSize, 
    fill: `rgb(
      ${[Gen.random(0, 255), Gen.random(0, 255), Gen.random(0, 255)]}
    )`
  });
}
```

This should give us a chance arrangement of colorful tiles on each
refresh. So far we've been quite restrained in our use of color,
controlling mainly the hue component of the hsl() function. This time
we're unleashing the full rgb color spectrum, so the results can range
from dramatic and dynamic to garish and grating (see Figure 8-4 for some
sample output). There is something I like about these results; the
coloring, however, can get a little too incongruous at times. So let's
use some filters to rein in the colors but retain the dynamic range.

![](./images/image062.jpg){width="3.15in" height="3.15in"}

***Figure 8-4.** Full-spectrum RGB tiles*

The first step is to desaturate the colors. For this, we can use the
feColorMatrix primitive, which takes two arguments: type and values. The
accepted values depend on the type, which can be as follows:

-   saturate: This determines the color saturation of the input. It
    accepts values between 0 (no saturation) and 1 (full saturation),
    though higher values may be accepted by browsers to allow for
    over-saturation.

-   hueRotate: This rotates the hue value by a specified angle, which is
    set in values. Setting values to 180 for example would invert all
    the hue values of the input source.

-   luminanceToAlpha: This converts the lightness of the input to alpha
    values and requires no values.

-   matrix: This is the most complex and powerful of the feColorMatrix
    types. It accepts a 5 by 5 color transformation matrix as the
    values, which matrix- multiplies the pixel component values of the
    input source. It's a little too advanced to delve into in this
    chapter.

Of the aforementioned, saturate is what we're looking for. To drain the
colors from our input, we need to set the values to 0. Let's set up a
filter now to do this. At the bottom of the sketch, initialize a new
filter as follows:

```
// Initialise the filter.
let filter = svg.createFilter('colourise');

// De-saturate the input.
filter.create('feColorMatrix').set({ 
  type: 'saturate', 
  values: 0,
  result: 'desaturate' 
});

// Apply the filter.
grid.set({ filter: 'url(#colourise)' });
```

This should result in a grayscale grid. Next, we want to choose a color
to mix into it, and for this, we'll use the feFlood primitive. Between
the feColorMatrix primitive and the last line where we apply the filter,
add the following code:

```
// Set a flood colour. 
filter.create('feFlood').set({ 
  flood_color: '#7F462C', 
  result: 'flood' 
});
```

This should add a sepia-brown color to the composition. The problem? It
simply floods the canvas, covering everything else. We need a way to
blend it with the result of the feColorMatrix desaturation.

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Blending</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Most vector and image editing applications have blending capabilities
built in, in the form of layer blending modes. SVG supports this feature
at the filter level in the form of the feBlend primitive.

A blending mode (or just blend mode) defines how colors interact when
elements overlap (whether the elements are individual shapes or entire
layers). If a blend mode is set to multiply for example, the final color
is the result of multiplying the top color by the bottom color, which
creates an effect similar to transparent film cells overlapping. If set
to screen, the top and bottom colors are inverted, multiplied, and
re-inverted, resulting in an effect similar to two images shone onto a
projection screen.

There are a number of blend modes supported by the SVG spec, and
describing each one is beyond the scope of this chapter, but for a
comprehensive treatment (including interactive examples), check out the
MDN entry at developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/blend-mode.

There are actually several blend modes that will work well in our case,
so what I'm going to do is store these in an array so we can select from
them later. Include the following code before our filter is initialized:

```
// Set up a blend modes array. 
let blendModes = ['screen',
  'overlay', 
  'lighten', 
  'color-dodge', 
  'soft-light', 
  'color'
];
```

Next, after where we defined the feFlood primitive, set up the feBlend
primitive. We'll randomize its mode attribute and set the first input to
the flood color and the second input to the desaturated grid.

```
// Randomise the blend mode. 
filter.create('feBlend').set({ 
  mode: Gen.random(blendModes), 
  in: 'flood', 
  in2: 'desaturate', 
  result: 'blend' 
});
```

The first input, in, acts as our top color, and the second input, in2,
acts as our background color. Our grid should have re-appeared at this
point in colorized form, but we've still got our flood color in the
foreground. We need a way to strip this out, which brings us to the next
section.

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Compositing</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

If you've ever watched the behind-the-scenes footage of some of your
favorite films, you'll likely have come across the green-screen
technique: the action hero who scales a skyscraper is, in reality,
hanging from a pulley with green fabric draped in the background. This
technique makes it easier to strip away the background from the
foreground and combine it later with separately captured footage.

Compositing is the act of fusing these two disparate elements together;
two sources combine and become one. It is similar to blending in many
respects, but the results are more pronounced and programmable. It has
more to do with how elements intersect than how their colors merge, and
the various compositing operations available to us can produce very
different results. Blending, on the other hand, tends to be more uniform
in its output.

The feComposite primitive allows us to perform compositing operations in
SVG. It takes two inputs, in and in2, and there are seven possible
values its operator attribute accepts: over, in, atop, xor, out,
lighter, and arithmetic. In Figure 8-5, I've illustrated six of these;
the arithmetic operator has no set output (it's fully customizable) and
is a little too complex to properly cover in this chapter.

![](./images/image063.jpg){width="3.5428565179352582in"
height="2.6657141294838147in"}

***Figure 8-5.** Six of the seven SVG compositing operations*

Because the feComposite primitive is so useful and something you'll
likely lean on if you further explore SVG filters, it's worth describing
each preset operator. In Figure 8-5, we can think of in as our
foreground and in2 as our green-screen background.

-   over: This is the default operator, where our foreground is simply
    placed over the background.

-   in: The portion of the foreground that overlaps with the background
    becomes the new output.

-   atop: The portion of the foreground that overlaps with the
    background is retained; the rest of the foreground is clipped.

-   xor: Those portions of the foreground and background that do not
    overlap are kept; the rest is removed. It's essentially the inverse
    of the in operator.

-   out: The portion of the foreground that falls outside the background
    is displayed.

-   lighter: The overlapping regions of the foreground and background
    are summed together (resulting in a lightening effect).

-   arithmetic: If this operator is chosen, four additional attributes
    must be defined, all numeric: k1, k2, k3, and k4. The output is then
    defined via the following formula: (k1 \* i1 \* i2) + (k2 \* i1) +
    (k3 \* i2)

\+ k4, where i1 and i2 represent in and in2, respectively. Yep, told
you it was complex! But the most subtle and customizable results can
be achieved using this operator, so it is well worth independent
exploration.

If we take the result of the feFlood primitive as our first input (the
foreground) and the SourceGraphic as the second input, the operator that
will achieve the effect we're looking for is atop. To recap, with this
operator, those portions of the foreground (feFlood) that overlap with
the background (SourceGraphic) are retained; the rest of feFlood should
be clipped.

Let's set this up now. Include the following code after the feBlend
primitive, before the filter is applied to the grid.

```
// Composite the blend 'atop' the original.
filter.create('feComposite').set({ 
  in: 'blend', 
  in2: 'SourceGraphic', 
  operator: 'atop' 
});
```

For me, this resulted in the output you see in Figure 8-6. I don't know
about you, but I see a pugnacious pup putting up his dukes, Ã  la
Scrappy- Doo (though that may well be my pareidolia at work). On each
refresh, you'll see something quite different, and while the color tones
vary, a common palette can be discerned due to the single feFlood color
we're drawing upon. This kind of effect would be quite difficult to
achieve without filters.

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
**Noise and Distortion**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

In this section, we'll introduce a new kind of noise, one that's
actually built in to the SVG spec itself. And we'll also explore how to
add some distortion to our filter pipeline. With these two ingredients,
along with the basics covered earlier, a whole world of effects opens up
to us.

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Turbulence</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

In Chapter 5, we introduced the SvJs Noise module, which allowed us to
use Perlin noise in our sketches. SVG also implements Perlin noise
inside its feTurbulence filter primitive, so what's the difference?

Well, with the Noise module, we can extract and play with noise *data*,
using its values to shape our vectors. With feTurbulence on the other
hand, we have a filter primitive that renders noise data directly, in
*pixel* form. This doesn't give us access to the underlying noise data,
but what we can do is easily alter the visual output by tweaking its
attributes and then feed it into other filter primitives. The
feTurbulence attributes are as follows:

-   baseFrequency: This is the only mandatory attribute, and we can
    think of it as defining the noise "zoom level." It's typical for the
    lowest value to start at 0.0001 (though you can start lower), and
    the higher the values go, the more of our noise terrain is revealed.
    If you supply two numeric values instead of one, the first will
    define the frequency along the x axis and the second along the y
    axis. Decoupling the values this way makes it possible to stretch or
    compress the resulting texture horizontally or vertically.

-   numOctaves: This attribute refers to the number of octaves present
    in the noise signal and determines the level of detail we can
    discern. Higher values render more natural results but are more
    processor-intensive. The most usable results lie in the range of 1
    to 5.

-   seed: This allows us to change the "location" from which we sample
    our noise. If the baseFrequency is our zoom level, the seed is our
    position. A valid seed value should be a positive integer anywhere
    from 0 to 10 million.

-   stitchTiles: This attribute accepts either stitch or noStitch and
    refers to how adjacent areas of the noise terrain are blended
    together. With it set to noStitch (the default), certain noise
    configurations can lead to a "tiling" effect, where the boundary
    between noise regions is quite pronounced. Setting a value of stitch
    can soften this.

-   type: This can be set to fractalNoise or turbulence (the default).
    The former produces the same kind of noise pattern across the red,
    green, blue, and alpha channels, and the latter produces a different
    pattern in the alpha channel. The fractalNoise type has a softer
    look and is great for generating gaseous textures like clouds. The
    turbulence type, on the other hand, is more liquid-like in
    appearance.

In Figure 8-7, we can see two instances of turbulence on the left and
two instances of fractalNoise on the right. The values vary only
slightly between instances, which should give you a sense of the
potential variation offered by this filter primitive.

![](./images/image065.jpg){width="4.725in"
height="1.6533333333333333in"}

***Figure 8-7.** Varying the base frequency and octaves for the two
noise types*

The best way to get a feel for how feTurbulence works is to tweak an
interactive example, so I've created a pen for you here for this
purpose:
[davidmatthew.ie/generative-art-javascript-svg#turbulence](https://davidmatthew.ie/generative-art-javascript-svg#turbulence).
I prefer working with baseFrequency values at the very low end of
spectrum and modifying the seed to select a pattern at random; this can
produce a huge variety of interesting textures. Very high baseFrequency
values can be useful however if you want to simulate something more
granular, like the classic film grain effect or a sandpaper-like
texture.

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Displacement</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

One filter primitive that works particularly well alongside feTurbulence
is feDisplacementMap. This primitive allows us to distort the first
input, in, using values from the second input, in2. This second input
acts as the map from which we can derive the displacement values, that
is, the values that decide how much distortion we should apply along the
x and y axes. This means that we could use the output from feTurbulence
to distort our SourceGraphic by feeding both through feDisplacementMap.

Besides the aforementioned in and in2, the feDisplacementMap primitive
has three other attributes: the first is scale, which determines how
much distortion to apply (i.e., to what extent is in distorted by in2).

The other two attributes, xChannelSelector and yChannelSelector, allow
us to specify which channels are responsible for horizontal and vertical
displacement. They accept values of R, G, B, or A, representing the
three color channels along with the alpha channel.

If we take a single color channel, R, as an example, its value can range
from 0 to 255. Values below 127 result in negative displacement (they're
shifted left along the x axis, or up along the y axis), whereas values
above 127 result in positive displacement (shifted to the right along
the x axis, or down along the y axis).

In Figure 8-8, the output of an feTurbulence primitive (center) is used
as the map to displace the source graphic (left), resulting in some soft
wave-like distortion (right).

![](./images/image066.jpg){width="4.725in"
height="1.3083333333333333in"}

***Figure 8-8.** Using turbulence as a displacement map source*

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Creating a Cosmic Bubble</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

This next example will piece together several of the filter primitives
we've covered so far and apply it to the simplest of source graphics:
the circle. Our aim will be to create something a little "cosmic" by
compositing together some turbulence, blur, and distortion.

First things first, make a copy of our template folder and rename it to
22-hubble-bubble (or another name of your choice). In the usual spot
below the background, let's set up our source graphic in the center of
the viewBox, randomizing its radius a little.

```
// Create the source graphic. svg.create(\'circle\').set({ cx: 500, cy:
500, r: Gen.random(250, 350), fill: \'#000\', filter: \'url(#cosmic)\'
});
```

You'll notice we've referenced our filter already but haven't yet
created it. Normally the order of our created elements matters; if we
create one circle and then another, the latter will be rendered "above"
the former in a layer-like manner. But as filters are created within a
defs element, it's ok to define them after the element to which they
apply. To recap, anything that lives inside the defs element isn't
directly rendered but must be referenced.

In the next step, we'll create the filter (ensuring the id matches the
reference to #cosmic), and add the first filter primitive to the chain:
feTurbulence. We'll randomize the seed, keep the dial low on the
baseFrequency, and crank up the numOctaves to 4, to bring out some of
the texture details.

```
// Initialise the filter. let filter = svg.createFilter(\'cosmic\');
// Create a random amount of turbulence.
filter.create(\'feTurbulence\').set({ type: \'fractalNoise\',
baseFrequency: Gen.random(0.002, 0.006, true), seed: Gen.random(0,
10000), numOctaves: 4, stitchTiles: \'stitch\', result: \'turbulence\'
});
```

Like feFlood, feTurbulence is a generator primitive that doesn't require
any input; it generates its own output directly. The result of this is
that once we initialize an feTurbulence primitive as the latest (or
only) link in the filter chain, it will simply flood the filter region
with its output (which is what you'll see if you run the code at this
point). We'll use feComposite to fix this later.

In our next step, we'll create a target region to displace (i.e., apply
distortion to). To create this target area, what we'll do is soften the
edges of the source graphic (the circle) using an feGaussianBlur; this
has the effect of introducing some transparency to the circle's
perimeter. This area of receding transparency (another way of describing
a blur) will be what we use to apply distortion to our turbulence.
Figure 8-8 shows the result of using turbulence as a displacement map
source; this time around we'll be doing the reverse and using turbulence
as the displacement map destination. The blurred area of our circle will
instead be our displacement map source. Here's how to set up this up
(with some randomness mixed in).

```
// Blur the edges of the source graphic.
filter.create(\'feGaussianBlur\').set({ stdDeviation: Gen.random(10,
25), in: \'SourceGraphic\', result: \'blurred\' });

// Displace the turbulence with the blurred edge of the circle.
filter.create(\'feDisplacementMap\').set({ in: \'turbulence\', in2:
\'blurred\', scale: Gen.random(250, 500), result: \'distortion\'
});
```

This results in a rim of displaced noise, as shown in Figure 8-9. Note
that we've omitted the xChannelSelector and yChannelSelector attributes
of feDisplacementMap; these both default to the alpha channel, which is
fine in our case.

![](./images/image067.jpg){width="3.15in" height="3.15in"}

***Figure 8-9.** Displacement using the blurred edge of a circle*

We're not fully done yet; as a final step, I want to cut away everything
beyond the perimeter of the blurred region. The solution to this is to
composite together the outputs of feDisplacementMap and feGaussianBlur
using the atop operator. We should then have something that resembles
Figure 8-10, our Hubble Bubble.

```
// Remove everything beyond the blurred perimeter.
filter.create('feComposite').set({ in: 'distortion', in2:
'blurred', operator: 'atop'
});
```

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
**Lighting and Texture**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Despite SVG being, by definition, a format for two-dimensional vector
graphics, among its filter primitives, you'll find two lighting effects:

feDiffuseLighting and feSpecularLighting. Normally the domain of
three-dimensional graphics, lighting typically requires a z-axis
component to operate so that surfaces or other objects that protrude in
space, that is, have depth, can catch the light cast by the source. SVG
coordinate space is devoid of any such third dimension or z axis, so how
exactly does lighting function in such an environment?

The answer is that the z axis is simulated by using "bump" maps.
Specifically, feDiffuseLighting and feSpecularLighting both interpret
the alpha channel of their connected inputs as a bump map source. A bump
map is just what it sounds like, a map of bumps, meaning any raised
regions of a surface, like slopes, peaks, folds, and wrinkles.

The challenge with these lighting primitives is knowing how to supply
them with nicely gradiented bump maps; anything with very sharp
transitions or a lot of areas of flat color can often appear
unpleasantly pixelated, or entirely unaffected. In Figure 8-11, we can
see the rather stark difference between a distant light source shining
on a circle with a radial gradient (left) vs. a circle of the same size
with a uniform fill (right).

![](./images/image069.jpg){width="3.74in"
height="1.9866666666666666in"}

***Figure 8-11.** Lighting cast on a radial gradient vs. a flat fill*

Lighting is one of those things in SVG that's very easy to get wrong.
When it does go awry, the results often look cheap, choppy, and jagged
and can put you off playing with lighting altogether. We need to
remember that with filters, we've moved from the realm of vectors to
that of pixels, where resolution matters. A more finely gradiented alpha
channel will translate to a higher-resolution bump map.

Fortunately, feTurbulence is a first-rate source of gradiented alpha
channel data. In our next sketch, we'll use feTurbulence along with
feDiffuseLighting and feDisplacementMap to simulate a rough, ripped
paper effect. But first, we need to delve a little more into the details
of the two aforementioned lighting primitives.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Diffuse and Specular Lighting</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
The feDiffuseLighting primitive simulates diffuse reflection. What this
means is that the light that strikes the surface of a diffuse-lit object
is scattered in all directions, as is characteristic of rough surface
textures (like linen). The feSpecularLighting primitive, on the other
hand, simulates specular reflection, which is characteristic of smoother
surfaces (like a bowling ball). With specular reflection, the light that
strikes the surface bounces at a definite angle. Figure 8-12 shows the
difference between a point light emitted by feDiffuseLighting (left) vs.
the same light emitted by feSpecularLighting (right).

***Figure 8-12.** Diffuse vs. specular lighting*

Both lighting primitives take a single input in as their bump map source
and a surfaceScale attribute, which defines the relative height of the
bump map. The color of the light can also be customized using the
lighting-color attribute, which is white by default. Both primitives
also share an attribute that defines a constant, diffuseConstant in the
case of feDiffuseLighting and specularConstant in the case of
feSpecularLighting. This constant determines the strength of the light
cast by the source. The feSpecularLighting primitive boasts an
additional attribute called specularExponent, which controls the focal
point strength (in Figure 8-12, this would determine the size of the
point light's reflection).
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Light Sources</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
I've mentioned distant lights and point lights a couple of times now but
haven't explained them. These refer to the type of light emitted by
either an feDiffuseLighting or feSpecularLighting primitive. By
themselves, these primitives do not emit any light; they require an
extra nested node to define the source. In other words, setting up a
light in SVG involves defining two elements: one, the outer node, which
defines whether the target surface of the lighting is diffuse or
specular; and two, the inner node, which defines the type of light
source to be used. Here's how an example might look in raw SVG:

```
<feDiffuseLighting in="SourceGraphic" surfaceScale="1.5">
  <feDistantLight azimuth="330" elevation="45" />
  </feDiffuseLighting>
```

There are three light source nodes: feDistantLight, an ambient light
that emits rays uniformly in all directions (such as the sun);
fePointLight, a more proximate light source that has a defined focal
point; and feSpotLight, a directional light that emits its rays through
a conical shape, the dimensions of which can be customized. Addressing
all three light sources would exceed the scope of this chapter, so we'll
stick to the first two: feDistantLight and fePointLight.

The feDistantLight source has two attributes: the azimuth, which
specifies the angle of direction of the light, and the elevation, which
specifies the height of the light source. Both are expressed in terms of
degrees. To use the sun analogy, at dawn it would rise in the east (at
an azimuth and elevation of 0) and by midday at the equator, it would
have climbed to an elevation of 90, directly overhead.

The fePointLight source has no azimuth or elevation; it is instead
defined entirely by x, y, and z attributes. The z attribute would
correspond with the elevation or height of the light source, and the x
and y attributes refer to the standard two-dimensional position in the
current coordinate space.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Simulating Textures</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Let's start a new sketch and flesh out some of the theory mentioned
previously. Copy our template folder and rename it to 23-rough-paper,
and in the usual spot below the background, create a parchment-colored
gradient that we'll apply to our paper. The paper itself will be a
compound path consisting of two shapes (the result of ripping it in
two). As you can see, it's possible to extend paths beyond a terminating
Z command by simply adding a new M command (the equivalent of lifting
your pen to start a new line elsewhere). Once we have the ripped paper
set up, we center it.

```
// Create a parchment-coloured gradient.
svg.createGradient('parchment', 
'linear', ['#fffbeb', '#fde68a'], 90);

// Create the path for the ripped paper.
let paper = svg.create('path').set({ 
  fill: 'url(#parchment)',
  stroke: '#4444',
  d: 'M 0,0 h 175 l 175,550 h -350 Z M 210,0 h 340 v 550 h -165 Z', 
  filter: 'url(#rough-paper)' 
});

// Centre it.
paper.moveTo(500, 500);
```

The composition we're keeping deliberately simple so that we can give
more focus to the filter effect. We'll initialize this next and add the
first primitive to the chain: feTurbulence. This will form the basis of
the paper grain texture.

```
// Initialise the filter. 
  let filter = svg.createFilter('rough-paper');

// Add turbulence to simulate paper grain.
filter.create('feTurbulence').set({ 
  type: 'fractalNoise',
  numOctaves: 5, 
  baseFrequency: 0.04, 
  seed: Gen.random(0, 100), 
  result: 'turbulence' 
});
```

The canvas should now be flooded with feTurbulence. What we'll do next
is shine a light on it, specifically an feDiffuseLighting primitive with
a nested feDistantLight node as the lighting type. This second node we
can create directly after the diffuse lighting primitive, using SvJs
method chaining.

```
// Shine diffuse lighting on the turbulence.
filter.create('feDiffuseLighting').set({ 
  surfaceScale: 1,
  diffuseConstant: 1.3, 
  in: 'turbulence', 
  result: 'lighting'
}).create('feDistantLight').set({ 
  azimuth: 180, 
  elevation: 45,
});
```

We should now have a paper-like texture covering the canvas. Next, we'll
rough up the edges of our source graphic by plugging some turbulence
into an feDisplacementMap primitive.

```
// Distort the paper source graphic with turbulence.
filter.create('feDisplacementMap').set({ 
  in: 'SourceGraphic', 
  in2: 'turbulence', 
  scale: 25, 
  result: 'distortion' 
});
```

This gives us an outline of aging paper with worn edges, but with no
texture. To re-introduce the result of the lighting effect, we need to
do some compositing. With the lighting output as the foreground and
rough-edged paper as the background, the in operator will achieve the
effect we're looking for.

```
// Merge the lighting with the rough-edged paper.
filter.create('feComposite').set({ 
  in: 'lighting', 
  in2: 'distortion', 
  operator: 'in', 
  result: 'composite' 
});
```

With the shape now in place and the texture showing through, we have a
believable rough and ripped paper texture. However, we're missing one
final ingredient: the color. To remedy this, we'll blend the output of
feComposite with the output of feDisplacementMap and use a mode of
multiply. This should salvage our original parchment gradient.

```
// Re-introduce the parchment gradient.
filter.create('feBlend').set({
  in: 'composite', 
  in2: 'distortion', 
  mode: 'multiply' 
});
```

Figure 8-13 shows the result. Not bad! While not quite impressive enough
to stand on its own (in my opinion at least), with variations of this
effect, you have a means of injecting additional visual interest into
other generative compositions.

![](./images/image071.jpg){width="3.15in" height="3.15in"}

***Figure 8-13.** Our rough and ready paper texture*

<h2>Generative Textures</h2>

The previous example lays the groundwork for what we'll try next.
Simulating textures is all well and good, but for the next example,
we'll go full generative, that is, relinquish some control and relish
the randomness of the results. In the process, we'll also demonstrate
the use of specular lighting of the point variety, so you can see how it
differs from diffuse, distant lighting.

Copy the template folder and call it 24-rocky-randomness. Below the
background, we'll set up our source graphic, which will be a simple
circle. To this circle, we'll apply both a gradient and a filter.

```
// Create our source graphic. 
svg.create('circle').set({ 
  r: 300, 
  cx: 500, 
  cy: 500, 
  fill: 'url(#random-gradient)', 
  filter: 'url(#rocky-randomness)' 
});
```

The next step is to set up a linear gradient. For this, we'll use an
array of three random colors, and we'll also randomize the gradient's
rotation.

```
// A random colour array.
let colours = [
  `hsl(${Gen.random(0, 360)} 80% 80% / 0.75)`,
  `hsl(${Gen.random(0, 360)} 80% 80% / 0.75)`,
  `hsl(${Gen.random(0, 360)} 80% 80% / 0.75)`
];
// A gradient with a randomised rotation and array of colours.
svg.createGradient('random-gradient', 'linear', colours, Gen.random(0, 360));
```

Now to the filter. As with our other examples, our first node will be an
feTurbulence primitive, which will act as our primary textural source.
The numOctaves will vary between 2 and 7, which will allow for quite a
degree of variation in the level of detail. The baseFrequency and seed
we'll also randomize.

```
// Initalise the filter. let filter =
svg.createFilter('rocky-randomness');

// Create the primary turbulence. 
filter.create('feTurbulence').set({
  type: 'turbulence', 
  numOctaves: Gen.random(2, 7), baseFrequency:
  Gen.random(0.003, 0.01, true), seed: Gen.random(0, 1000), 
  result: 'turbulence' });
```

Now we have raw turbulence covering the canvas, and while it does vary
on each refresh, it still feels a little too uniform. How can we create
something more organic and a little less grid-like? Well, we could
distort it with ... more turbulence!

To do this, we'll set up another feTurbulence primitive, this time using
fractalNoise. The baseFrequency we'll ramp up a little, but we'll keep
numOctaves and the seed to a similar range. Then we'll plug both into
feDisplacementMap, randomize the scale value (which determines the
strength of the distortion), and set R and G as the x and y channel
selectors (purely because I didn't really like the default output of
alpha on this occasion).

```
// Set up another instance of turbulence.
filter.create('feTurbulence').set({ 
  type: 'fractalNoise',
  numOctaves: Gen.random(3, 7), 
  baseFrequency: Gen.random(0.01, 0.07, true), 
  seed: Gen.random(0, 1000), 
  result: 'noise'
});
// Distort the first instance of turbulence with the second.
filter.create('feDisplacementMap').set({ 
  in: 'turbulence', 
  in2: 'noise', 
  scale: Gen.random(25, 40), 
  xChannelSelector: 'R',
  yChannelSelector: 'G', 
  result: 'distortion' 
});
```

We have some more natural-looking noise now, so let's spin up some
specular lighting and see how the noise looks when lit up. We'll utilize
Gen. random() on most of the attributes, including the point light
coordinates.

```
// Shine a specular point light on the distorted output.
filter.create('feSpecularLighting').set({ 
  in: 'distortion',
  surfaceScale: Gen.random(5, 30), 
  specularConstant: Gen.random(2, 6),
  specularExponent: Gen.random(10, 25), 
  result: 'lighting'
}).create('fePointLight').set({ 
  x: Gen.random([-50, 500, 1050]), 
  y: Gen.random([-50, 1050]), 
  z: Gen.random(50, 250) 
});
```

For the x and y coordinates, you'll notice we're using Gen.random() to
pick from an array of values rather than a range; if you inspect these
values, you'll see that these combinations keep the lighting to the
periphery of the canvas. This is mainly to prevent any direct shine
(think of an unwelcome camera flash in a photograph). If you load up the
sketch at this point, you should see some interesting generative terrain
emerge. We're not done yet though.

Before we bring the terrain and the source graphic back together, we're
going to soften the edges of the latter with some feGaussianBlur. We'll
then use feComposite along with the in operator as we've done in
previous sketches, before recovering the original gradient using another
feComposite primitive, this time with the atop operator.

```
// Blur the source graphic.
filter.create('feGaussianBlur').set({ 
  in: 'SourceGraphic',
  stdDeviation: Gen.random(25, 
  50), 
  result: 'blur' 
});

// Bring the lit texture in via the blurred source graphic.
filter.create('feComposite').set({ 
  in: 'lighting', 
  in2: 'blur',
  operator: 'in', 
  result: 'comp1' 
});

// Recover the original gradient. 
filter.create('feComposite').set({
  in: 'blur', 
  in2: 'comp1', 
  operator: 'atop' 
});
```

And now we're ready to see some results! Figure 8-14 shows a render I
particularly liked, but the variation in this sketch is quite large so
it's best to play around until you land on something you like.

![](./images/image072.jpg){width="3.15in" height="3.15in"}

***Figure 8-14.** Specular random rockiness*

And that concludes our foray into filters. As I mentioned before,
there's so much more to explore where filters are concerned, and there
are quite a few primitives I didn't have the space to touch on. It
definitely warrants (and rewards) further independent exploration.

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
**Summary**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

Let's do a quick recap of what was covered in this our penultimate
chapter:

-   How filters are constructed

-   Filter regions and the SvJs createFilter() method

-   Basic primitives like feGaussianBlur, feFlood, and feDropShadow

-   More complex primitives like feComposite and feBlend that tie other
    primitives together

-   The power of the feTurbulence primitive and its creative
    possibilities

-   Distorting other primitives using feDisplacementMap

-   Lighting and how three dimensions can be simulated using bump maps

-   Diffuse and specular lighting and the various light source types

-   How turbulence, displacement, and lighting can be used together to
    simulate and generate textures

In the next chapter, we'll wrap things up and touch on some topics that
can help take your generative art to the next level.

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h1 id="ch9">CHAPTER 9: The Generative Way</h1>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Congratulations for having come this far! We've covered a lot, so it's
time to take stock, stretch out those mental muscles, and make sure we
don't end this book with an injury. We'll wind down by reviewing each
chapter in little chunks, and we'll wrap up by previewing some of the
paths you might pursue next in your generative journey.

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
**The Journey So Far**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
We began with an introduction to SVG and what sets it apart from raster
formats like PNG and JPG. We then moved on to the SvJs library and
learned how to set up a local front-end development environment. The
first chapter closed with a bit of a code dump to serve up some visual
inspiration, but it was a little light on explanation, so the following
two chapters picked up the slack.

For those new to JavaScript and/or programming in general, Chapter 2
offered a primer, while Chapter 3 delved into the core functionality of
the SvJs library. We explored how to create basic shapes and how to work
with text, groups, gradients, and patterns, and we created some colorful
compositions and optical illusions along the way.

With the introduction of randomness in Chapter 4, we were finally able
to go full generative and create sketches with results not rigidly set
in advance. We learned how to randomize numbers within a range, randomly
select items from an array, and construct regular grids using that

staple of generative art, the nested for loop. We extended our knowledge
of SVG with masks and clip paths and played with Gaussian and Pareto
probability distributions.

Noise was introduced in Chapter 5 as a way of injecting a more organic
kind of variation into our sketches, and other useful generative
functions were covered to help us constrain and map these noise values
to more useful ranges. In Chapter 6, we tapped into the power of the
path element and its arsenal of commands, and we learned how to create
lines and curves of the quadratic, cubic Bezier, and elliptical arc
variety.

Chapter 7 was all about making things move. We explored event listeners
and user interaction and reviewed no less than four different ways of
animating SVG. We covered basic collision detection and circular motion,
before continuing on to filters in Chapter 8. There we focused on a
subset of filter primitives of most immediate use to the generative
artist, and we learned how to connect these primitives together to
achieve a variety of different effects.

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
**The Voyage Forward**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
So where do you go from here? Have we fully explored the field of
generative art, mapped all the territory? Not in the slightest! We've
only really circled the tip of the proverbial iceberg, hinting at the
hulking structure beneath. So if you do want to dive a little deeper
yourself, I'll tentatively suggest some further topics (with the caveat
that the material we've covered so far could be expanded upon ad
infinitum).

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Trigonometry</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
I was only able to offer a very cursory treatment of trigonometry in
Chapter 7, so if this was your first time encountering the likes of
Math.

PI and Math.sin(), don't expect these concepts to take root (squared or
otherwise ... apologies, poor pun). Trigonometry is a topic that
deserves a deep dive of its own, and like much of the material in this
book, the more exposure and practice you get -- or better yet, the more
you play -- the more comfortable you'll be.

That said, I do find that interactive visualizations are a great way to
kickstart comprehension, so to that end, I've set up a sketch showing
the relationship between circular motion and right-angled triangles (the
very foundation of trigonometry), a freezeframe of which you can see in
Figure 9-1.

![](./images/image073.jpg){width="3.15in" height="3.15in"}

***Figure 9-1.** An interactive trigonometry visualization*

As with the rest of the examples in this chapter, it's intended to
illustrate rather than instruct, so the code isn't included here. You
can, however, play with this particular example on the book's dedicated
web page and inspect the code there if so inclined. I've also included
further reading and resources that should help you delve into the topic,
including those I've relied upon myself over the years. These can be
found at
[davidmatthew.ie/generative-art-javascript-svg/#trigonometry](http://ï»¿davidmatthew.ie/generative-art-javascript-svg/#trigonometryï»¿).

If you don't consider yourself to be of a particularly mathematical
mindset, please don't be dissuaded from exploring this fascinating
subject. You only need to be acquainted with a relatively small subset
of it to tap into its creative possibilities, and this doesn't have to
involve complicated equations.

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Fractals</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

Another subject that doesn't necessitate complicated equations or mind-
bending mathematical prowess is fractals. Yes, a fractal is a
mathematical object, and some are enormously complex, but fractals in
general are based on simple principles of recursion and self-similarity.

Recursion essentially means self-reference. A recursive function is one
that continuously calls itself, an example of which we encountered in
Chapter 7 with requestAnimationFrame(). Self-similarity, in relation to
fractals, means that one part will resemble the whole, and vice versa.
This is illustrated in Figure 9-2, which shows a famous fractal known as
the Sierpinski triangle. As you can see, each building block is a
reflection of the structure taken in its entirety.

![](./images/image074.jpg){width="3.15in" height="3.15in"}

***Figure 9-2.** Self-similarity in the Sierpinski triangle*

Where does recursion come in? Well, it can be found in every fractal,
including the Sierpinski triangle, but to really illustrate the idea,
let's take another well-known specimen, the Von Koch snowflake. The
algorithm used to construct this fractal could be distilled down to the
following (albeit simplified) steps:

1.  Construct an equilateral triangle.

2.  Divide each side into three segments.

3.  Remove the central segment.

4.  Repeat step 1.

The fourth step is what makes this algorithm recursive. Figure 9-3 shows
what this process would look like after just three further iterations.
In theory, these steps could continue on indefinitely, producing an
ever- more intricate, endlessly magnifiable perimeter, which is why
fractals

are sometimes seen as "windows into infinity." In practice, iterations
are usually limited in line with screen resolution or otherwise capped
to prevent our browsers crashing and our processors crunching numbers
they can no longer handle.

![](./images/image075.jpg){width="3.15in" height="3.15in"}

***Figure 9-3.** Recursively constructing the Von Koch snowflake*

Fractals open up an entire universe of exploration and inspiration for
the generative artist, far beyond what I've been able to hint at here.
If your interest is piqued at this point, I've pooled together further
resources at <a href="https://davidmatthew.ie/generative-art-javascript-svg/#fractalsï»¿">
davidmatthew.ie/generative-art-javascript-svg/#fractals</a> that I'd encourage you to explore.

<h2>Systems Simulations</h2>

From simple rules, unexpected complexity often emerges; this is not only
true for fractals, but for a number of natural systems. Simulating such
systems is usually the business of serious science, but in the more
advanced areas of generative art, you'll see simulations of basic
physics (think gravity, mass, density, etc.), particle systems (like
fog, fire, and smoke), and organic behavior (from single cell
interactions to the flocking patterns of birds).

Now, SVG isn't always the medium of choice for systems simulations --
particle systems, for example, will perform better in pixel-based
environments like the HTML canvas -- but performance concerns aside, if
you're looking to add an extra layer to your compositions, sprinkling a
bit of science on top of the art, simulating natural systems can
certainly be worth the work involved. A single sketch could become the
basis of an endless stream of creative output, as much application as
artwork.

John Conway's Game of Life is a good example of an organic simulation;
it's a grid-based, zero-player game that simulates patterns of growth,
decline, and evolution. Each cell in the grid can be in one of two
states: "alive" or "dead." Living cells contain a fill color; dead cells
do not. The rules that underpin the game are surprisingly simple, yet
complexity can nonetheless emerge in the form of unexpected patterns and
clusters of cells battling it out for survival. These rules are as
follows:

1.  Any living cell with either one or zero neighbors dies.

2.  Any living cell with either two or three neighbors survives to the
    next "generation" (or iteration).

3.  Any living cell with four or more neighbors dies.

4.  Any empty (i.e., dead) cell with exactly three neighbors spawns to
    life.

Figure 9-4 shows a game a few generations in. Some clusters (like the
square of cells in the top left and bottom right corners) are in stasis,
meaning they survive but don't spread and thrive. Other cells are
actively sprawling, exploring, disappearing, and re-spawning. It can be
fun to watch!

![](./images/image076.jpg){width="3.15in" height="3.15in"}

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 id="ch9-4">9.4 Closing Comments</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
At this stage, I've done enough summarizing, so I'd like to leave you
with some (rather opinionated) parting tips to support you in your
generative endeavors:

<ul>
  <li>Be comfortable never knowing enough. With any kind of coding,
    there's always so much more to know. And that's ok.</li>
  <li>Try to block off bits of time to play with code; you don't need to
    commit to all-nighters. Small habit-forming steps are more
    sustainable than the odd sprint here and there.</li>
  <li>Embrace simplicity; generative art doesn't have to be complicated to
    be good.</li>
  <li>Take inspiration from other artists; reverse-engineer examples that
    inspire you.</li>
  <li>Don't just copy; understand what you implement, and always put your
    own spin on things. It'll help you develop your own style.</li>
  <li>Give back. Get involved in the community. Contribute code,
    constructive critiques, or simply leave a positive comment on
    another artist's work and let them know you appreciate their
    efforts.</li>
  <li>And finally, appreciate your own efforts, regardless of the results.
    Output isn't everything, and your generative journey is your own.</li>

<h2 id="geeks4geeks">Geeks 4 Geeks example SVG</h2>

SVG or Scalar Vector Graphics is Extended Markup Language-based graphics supporting 2 
dimensional animations of images enhancing interactiveness. The specifications of SVG 
are open standards by World Wide Web Consortium defined in XML text files. These files 
can be changed or created with any drawing software or text file editors.

The jQuery provides Drawsvg.js plugin to draw or animate SVG images in a variety of ways 
for a developerâs web pages, which is very lightweight and easy to use. The paths of SVG 
images are drawn in animation along with stagger and easing support options.

Example 1: The following example demonstrates the simple animation of rectangle with 
circular vertex, using jQuery DrawSVG plugin. The path element is the most significant 
element for creating basic shapes like lines and arcs in SVG library. It can also create 
complex shapes combining many basic ones. âdâ is the parameter for defining shape of 
element.
