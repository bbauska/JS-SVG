### Utilizing Scalable Vector Graphics and Algorithms for Creative Coding and Design

Design Thinking is a set of strategic and creative processes and principles
used in the planning and creation of products and solutions to human-
centered design problems.
With design and innovation being two key driving principles, this
series focuses on, but is not limited to, the following areas and topics:

  - User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) Design
  - Psychology of Design
  - Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
  - Ergonomic Design
  - Product Development and Management
  - Virtual and Mixed Reality (VR/XR)
  - User-Centered Built Environments and Smart Homes
  - Accessibility, Sustainability and Environmental Design
  - Learning and Instructional Design
  - Strategy and best practices

This series publishes books aimed at designers, developers, storytellers
and problem-solvers in industry to help them understand current
developments and best practices at the cutting edge of creativity, to invent
new paradigms and solutions, and challenge Creatives to push boundaries
to design bigger and better than before.

## Introduction
### What You Should Know
As a reader, what should you know before tackling this book? It will
no doubt be easier if you are comfortable with the core concepts of
programming, like variables, functions, loops, and conditionals. These
kinds of concepts carry over from language to language, differing mainly
with respect to syntax, so if you come from a language other than
JavaScript, then that’s completely fine.
If you have no prior programming experience, we will be covering
the concepts required in Chapter 2, but I should emphasize that this
book is not intended to be an introduction to programming. The second
chapter is best thought of as a primer, a jumping-off point for a deeper
dive elsewhere. A short introductory course would really benefit you here.
Personally I’d recommend the wonderful freeCodeCamp.com, a site I’ve
spent many hours using myself. It offers free interactive tutorials on the
basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and much more besides.
For those coming from another language, like Python, PHP, or C#, the
second chapter may still be valuable, to be sure you’re acquainted with the
syntax and some of the idiosyncrasies of JavaScript.
If you’re already a practicing web developer, you could skip (or
quickly skim) Chapter 2, depending on your level of experience. If you’re
unfamiliar with any of the techniques or syntax used in our opening
example (which we’ll end Chapter 1 with), I’d encourage you to give the
second chapter a read, where they’ll be fully explained. The field of web
development is vast enough that what is bread and butter to one developer
might be bleeding edge to another.
